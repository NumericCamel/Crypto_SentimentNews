BTC’s Future Hangs In Balance Recent insights from crypto analyst Doctor Profit suggest that the market is closely divided, with equal chances—50%—of a 0.25% or 0.50% rate cut. However, Doctor Profit is confident that the Fed will opt for the larger cut, citing a need for decisive action in the current economic climate. He notes, “A 0.25% cut is simply too little for where we are now.”  Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Trims Gains, Can This Key Support Hold Losses? The analyst argues that failing to implement a 0.50% cut could lead to market turmoil reminiscent of the “Blood Monday” experienced on August 5, which saw Bitcoin plummet to lows of $48,900, resulting in a nearly 25% price drop. According to Doctor Profit, this could include acknowledging the Fed’s past strategies and an optimistic outlook for the economy, potentially paving the way for future rate cuts. Given these potential scenarios, the analyst warns of the potential for market manipulation and “scam wicks” that could mislead investors on both sides of the trade. In addition, geopolitical tensions, particularly regarding the Israel-Lebanon situation, add another layer of complexity and may exacerbate market fears and volatility. Despite the short-term risks, Doctor Profit remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, particularly through the end of Q3 2025. The analyst believes that any short-term panic will ultimately be countered by a return to expansive monetary policy, as seen in the recent influx of USDT and other cash injections into the market. He highlights that once the rate cuts are implemented, the Fed’s money printing will likely resume, providing a foundation for recovery. Bitcoin Price Analysis Looking deeper into the current price action, analyst Ali Martinez recently noted that Bitcoin trades within a parallel channel on the hourly chart.  Martinez contends that Bitcoin could bounce back to the middle or upper levels if the lower border holds, targeting $60,200 or $62,000. However, Martinez warns that a break below the support level of $58,100 could lead to a drop towards $55,000. Related Reading: Solana Losses Ground, Drops Below $137 As Bearish Momentum Builds Zooming out to a broader perspective, Martinez also highlights concerning trends in Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Momentum. Since breaking below the $66,750 mark in June, Bitcoin has been in a downtrend, and this negative trend has yet to show signs of reversal.  To invalidate this indicator, BTC needs to break above this level and reclaim it as support, which could signal the continuation of an expected rally towards the all-time high of $73,700 reached in March this year. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $58,440, recording losses of over 3% in the 24-hour.  Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Even so, most ETH holders are upbeat, expecting prices to turn around the corner and soar, even breaking above July highs of around $3,500. 61% Of ETH Holders In The Money Amid this development and the general lull, IntoTheBlock data shows that 61% of all ETH holders are in the money. That over 50% of all ETH holders are in green despite the coin shedding nearly 35% from July highs and nearly 45% from 2024 highs points to resilience, especially in the face of determined bears. Related Reading: Glassnode Founders Say Bitcoin Crash To $37,000 Wouldn’t Be A Bad Thing, Here’s Why Technically, the resilience among ETH holders indicates a wave of optimism sweeping through its ecosystem. According to IntoTheBlock, this development means that at current levels, more ETH holders are making money, way higher than in bear market cycles. Then, profitability tends to fall drastically. For context, IntoTheBlock analysts note that during the 2019/2020 period, when prices fell, the percentage of profitable holders at one point dropped to as low as 10%. Additionally, in the last bear run, the percentage of ETH holders making money fell to 46%. However, this was way higher than the 3% when ETH prices dumped to as low as 3% in the depth of the 2018 bear run. Ethereum Holders Confident, Support Lies At $2,290 And $2,360 ETH’s profitability percentage has evolved over the years, pointing to a maturing market where holders are still confident about what lies ahead. According to Dune data, there are 128,804,395 ETH in the circulating supply. Out of this, the top 1,000 addresses control over 49.1 million or 38.15%. If IntoTheBlock data is anything to go by, most of these whales are in the green, making money. Accordingly, they won’t be incentivized to sell, increasing pressure on ETH. Related Reading: Solana Losses Ground, Drops Below $137 As Bearish Momentum Builds Looking closer at on-chain data, one analyst notes that ETH has a critical support at between $2,290 and $2,360. In this zone, nearly 1.9 million addresses were bought and currently hold approximately 52.3 million ETH. Millions of ETH were bought at this level, meaning it is a critical loading zone. If broken, the analyst predicts sharp losses that will drop the coin below August lows to $1,800 in a bear trend continuation formation.

Over the past five months, Dogecoin has largely traded in a downtrend with the formation of lower highs and lower lows. This consistent downward pressure has led to the development of a classic price pattern known as a falling wedge. According to a technical analyst who has been closely tracking Dogecoin’s movements, the daily chart suggests that the falling wedge is nearing its conclusion, and a bullish breakout is now in sight. If Dogecoin successfully breaks out of this wedge, the analyst projects a price target of $0.20. Dogecoin Falling Wedge Breaking Bullish A falling wedge is a narrowing price channel that typically signals a reversal from bearish to bullish momentum. The key feature of this pattern is that it shows a gradual reduction in the downward price movement as buyers start to step in, causing price consolidation. In the case of Dogecoin, this pattern was highlighted by a technical analyst known pseudonymously as Crypto Yapper on social media platform X.  Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Warning For Bullish Investors, Says Solana Will Crash 42% To $80 According to the DOGE/USDT chart on the 1D candlestick, DOGE has largely been on a downtrend since it peaked at its yearly high of $0.22 in March. At one point, DOGE fell by 63% from $0.22 to a low of $0.08 on August 5. Following this low point in early August, Dogecoin has managed to stage a modest recovery, rising by approximately 25% to its current level. However, DOGE has yet to break above the upper resistance trendline of the falling wedge pattern. $DOGE almost Breaking Out ! This Falling Wedge on the #DOGE daily chart is close to breaking Bullish The break out target for #Dogecoin will be $0.20 pic.twitter.com/MoAQe1Xo6r — Crypto Yapper (@CryptoYapper) September 14, 2024 Since bouncing off $0.088 on September 6, DOGE has traveled upwards to retest the upper trendline of the falling wedge at around $0.108. As noted by Crypto Yapper, a successful break to the upside would see DOGE doubling its current value and reaching $0.20. While this price target might seem modest at first glance, especially considering that Dogecoin had already surpassed $0.20 earlier in the year, it represents the cryptocurrency’s recovery from its prolonged downtrend. This, in turn, could lead to a total change into bullish sentiment, with DOGE eventually breaking above $0.22. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Will Reach $68,000 By End Of September, $90,000 In December Echoing the falling wedge pattern analysis is another DOGE trader (CryptoHotep). According to him, DOGE at $0.10 is a gift. His post featured a similar DOGE/USD price chart featuring the falling wedge pattern from $0.22, albeit with the upper trendline only. This comment was made regarding a forecasted breakout above the upper trendline. Although there wasn’t a projected price target, his comment showed this is probably the best time to buy DOGE before the projected breakout.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Monthly Downtrend: Can DOGE Reach $12?,2024-09-16 19:30:12+00:00,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is holding strong above a key price level after a small market dip on Sunday, putting it at a crucial turning point. The meme coin recently broke out of a monthly downtrend that has kept its price suppressed since late March, signaling a potential shift in momentum.  Related Reading: Analyst Predicts AVAX Breakout: Is $30 The Next Target? Analysts and investors are growing increasingly optimistic about DOGE’s latest price action, with some predicting that if Dogecoin breaks above the $0.12 mark, it could trigger a larger rally in the meme coin space.  However, the next few days will be critical in determining whether DOGE can lead this rally or if it will need a period of consolidation before pushing higher. As the broader crypto market looks for direction, all eyes are on Dogecoin to see if it can capitalize on this positive momentum and set the stage for further gains. Dogecoin Holding Strong Above $0.10  Dogecoin (DOGE) has been between $0.092 and $0.115 since early August, forming a consolidation pattern many analysts believe signals accumulation by smart money. This consolidation suggests that significant players may be preparing for a potential breakout. Some analysts are particularly optimistic, stating that DOGE is breaking out of a monthly downtrend channel that began in late March when Dogecoin was trading at $0.22. One top analyst and investor, Daan, shared a technical analysis on X showing DOGE breaking through this downtrend line, which presents a new opportunity for meme coin investors. Daan emphasizes that if DOGE holds above the critical $0.105 support and can break above the $0.12 level with conviction, the meme coin could aggressively surge to higher prices. According to Daan, once Dogecoin confirms an uptrend, its price skyrockets rapidly, leaving no room for hesitation. Historically, when DOGE enters such phases, it experiences sharp upward movements accompanied by high volatility. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Faces Serious Risk After Failing To Close Above Key Level – Details This potential move has drawn attention to Dogecoin, as investors and traders alike are eager to see if it will continue to dominate the meme coin sector. The next few days and weeks will be critical in determining whether DOGE can sustain its momentum and break through these key resistance levels. DOGE Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.101 after experiencing a 7% dip since Friday. Before this decline, DOGE surged over 22% from local lows on September 6, marking a strong recovery in a short period. Last Friday, the price broke above the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at around $0.103, often seen as a signal of short-term strength. However, despite this move, DOGE has struggled to maintain its position above the 4H 200 EMA, and recent price action has hovered just below this key level. For DOGE to regain bullish momentum, it is essential for the price to reclaim the 4H 200 EMA and hold above it. This would provide short-term support and potentially pave the way for targeting higher prices. On the other hand, if DOGE fails to close above this EMA, a deeper correction is likely, with the next major support level expected around $0.097.

In fact, the price forecast of the token will shine hope for investors. AVAX is seen going up 70.68% over the next three months, showing a bounce from the recent prices, analysis from CoinCheckup shows. This bullish sentiment is bolstered by long-term projections that suggest a 166% growth over the next year. It seems AVAX is poised for recovery, making it an intriguing asset for traders keeping an eye on the market. Revenue Plunge And On-Chain Activity Revenue for the Avalanche ecosystem was another source of worry, as its value went down from 176,700 AVAX in Q2 2024 to 96,200 AVAX during the same period. In dollar terms, that translated into $7.5 million going down to $3.5 million. Pullback is due to slowed activity across different on-chain platforms. However, some analysts believe that a renewed interest in on-chain-based transactions could help revive revenue growth in the short term. Despite these drops, staking remains robust within the Avalanche ecosystem. There is a 6% increase in the number of staked AVAX tokens due to new measures to boost staking. Staking rewards continue to attract new investors despite a fall in active validator count by 7%. This reflects some unease among validators amidst these market conditions. Network Stability Average transaction counts remain mixed. With approximately 11,262 transactions and an average block time of 1.61 seconds, Avalanche is showing stability. More than 2% of the total coins have been sent from the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm wallet. Despite the recorded drops, new initiatives are expected to boost staking and future coin balances.

Tether (USDT) and GMX increased transaction volumes, which indicated specific sectors in the system are doing well despite this broad slowdown for the crypto market. Since AVAX is preparing for a potential rebound from the market, its investors may be able to see renewed interest in the asset in case such forecasted growth in price comes true. The partial recovery in the transaction volumes for selected protocols also suggests something more is being involved under the surface–a sign that Avalanche might pick up fast once the crypto market picks up. For now, investors are keen enough to observe how AVAX acts in the short and medium terms. Featured image from Durango.com, chart from TradingView",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Crypto Trends To Watch: Analyst Details 10 Reasons That Could Lead To Massive Q4 Gains,2024-09-16 17:04:12+00:00,"As the crypto market grapples with significant volatility and uncertainty, expert analyst Miles Deutscher has outlined ten reasons to be optimistic about the year’s fourth quarter (Q4). With Q4 fast approaching, Deutscher emphasizes that a monumental market shift could catch many investors off guard. Trends And Factors That Could Impact The Crypto Market In a recent social media post, Deutscher broke down his analysis into seasonality, macroeconomic factors, and crypto-specific elements.  Deutscher begins by discussing the concept of seasonality, noting that market movements often follow cyclical patterns. Related Reading: Ethereum In Danger: Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Crash To $1,800 Historically, Q4 has proven to be the strongest quarter for equities, with the S&P 500 gaining an average of 3.8% since 1945 and rising 77% of the time. Bitcoin (BTC) has also shown notable performance during this period, averaging a return of 88.84%. Deutscher points to the previous two Halving years, where Bitcoin saw gains of 58.17% in 2016 and 168.02% in 2020. He notes that Q3 typically represents a challenging period for BTC, making the upcoming months particularly significant. The period from October to April is often regarded as crypto’s “boom season,” further underscoring the potential for gains. Moving beyond seasonal trends, Deutscher highlights several macroeconomic factors that could impact the crypto market. With the US federal election just two months away, he suggests a Trump presidency could be more favorable for the market. However, a Kamala Harris win would not be catastrophic. Current odds from Polymarket indicate a near 50/50 split on the election outcome. Deutscher also points to cooling inflation rates and the anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts as pivotal elements. The recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading is the lowest since February 2021, and a Fed pivot could be imminent. He explains that while rate cuts are often viewed negatively, historical data shows they can be bullish during non-recessionary periods. Additionally, a potential weakening of the US dollar, resulting from rate cuts, would likely benefit risk assets, including Bitcoin. Deutscher emphasizes that Bitcoin is highly correlated with global liquidity and is forecasted to continue rising into 2025, creating a favorable environment for cryptocurrency. Bullish On Long-Term Growth Prospects In the realm of crypto-specific dynamics, Deutscher notes that many retail investors have been flushed out of the market. Metrics such as Google Trends and social engagement indicate a significant drop in retail participation, suggesting that those remaining may be better positioned for potential gains. The analyst also observes a decline in the Coinbase app’s rankings, which previously surged during market highs. This trend points to a broader sense of apathy among retail investors, but Deutscher believes that such off-side positioning could pave the way for aggressive market expansion. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Nosedives Over 5%, Pressure Mounts on Bulls Furthermore, Deutscher highlights the upcoming repayment of $16 billion to FTX creditors. Unlike the previous cash drain associated with the Mt. Gox refunds to affected users, these paybacks could inject liquidity into the market, with many users likely to reinvest their capital. Ultimately, it is clear that Deutscher presents a bullish case for Q4, and why it could be a turning point for the crypto market. While he acknowledges that volatility is natural in the digital asset ecosystem, he remains optimistic about significant gains in the medium to long term. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $57,880, recording losses of nearly 4% in the 24 hours.  Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reports indicate that approximately $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from various crypto exchanges, signaling a renewed interest and confidence in the leading cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin Accumulation Frenzy Resumes Data from IntoTheBlock has revealed a new accumulation trend amongst Bitcoin investors. According to the financial service platform, roughly $1.29 billion worth of BTC has exited various Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) in the last week.  Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Warning For Bullish Investors, Says Solana Will Crash 42% To $80 This development signals a shift in investors’ sentiment from a previously bearish stance. Just this September, Bitcoin has experienced severe price fluctuations and volatility, raising concerns amongst investors about the cryptocurrency’s future outlook. There have even been reports of liquidation in the market, with analysts noting that September is historically a bearish period for the crypto market.  With Bitcoin now seeing renewed momentum and experiencing a price surge above the $60,000 mark, investors’ interest in the cryptocurrency has resurged. Based on IntoTheBlock’s report, the majority of Bitcoin outflows, amounting to 12,420 BTC, from crypto exchanges occurred on Tuesday, September 10. During this time, the price of the cryptocurrency had been trading below $60,000, suggesting that investors were accumulating in anticipation of a potential price surge.  Apparently, Bitcoin holders had begun selling their holdings and taking profits around Friday, September 13. ITB’s data also revealed that 82% of BTC investors are currently making gains, while 13% are in loss.  Interestingly, this accumulation trend has extended its influence towards Bitcoin whales. In an X (formerly Twitter) post on September 14, popular crypto trader, Ash Crypto, unveiled a lofty Bitcoin transaction involving the purchase of 1,062 BTC, valued at $64 million by an anonymous whale.  With the new Bitcoin addition, the unidentified whale now holds a whopping 10,043 BTC, worth approximately $600 million, based on exchange rates at the time. This move by the whale is also an indication that the market is transitioning into a more bullish and positive sentiment. This trend is common after a market correction or a decline in a cryptocurrency, where prices have reached a perceived low.  Will BTC’s Price Hit $75,000? The recent spike in Bitcoin accumulation indicates that investors are now looking favorably at the cryptocurrency, possibly anticipating a price increase in the future. This new trend could potentially trigger a rally to new all-time highs around $75,000 if it continues.  Related Reading: ‘Super Guppy’ Indicator Shows XRP Is Ready For A Surge To $99 Earlier this year, when Bitcoin accumulation was at one of its highest, the price of the cryptocurrency had surged to its current all-time high of above $73,000. This bullish development could reoccur as demand and interest in the cryptocurrency surges.  Although Bitcoin saw a rise above $60,000 over the past week, its price is now down by 2.37% and currently trading at $58,739, according to CoinMarketCap.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Nervos Network (CKB) Price Prediction 2024, 2025 & 2026, CKB Whales Add Mpeppe To Crypto Bags",2024-09-16 16:00:54+00:00,"Nervos Network (CKB) has caught the attention of the broader crypto community, with its price soaring by 55% in the last 24 hours. This bullish sentiment, driven by strong market fundamentals and increased interest from institutional investors, suggests that Nervos Network (CKB) could be poised for even more significant gains in the coming years. In this article, we will dive into Nervos Network (CKB)’s price prediction for 2024, 2025, and 2026, and explore why CKB whales are adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios. 2024 Price Prediction: A Bullish Year Ahead As of September 2024, Nervos Network (CKB) is trading at $0.0139, marking a significant 55.04% increase compared to 24 hours ago. The recent listing on Upbit has propelled the token into the limelight, and with the current bullish trend, Nervos Network (CKB) could easily see its price rise further. Analysts predict that by the end of 2024, Nervos Network (CKB) could reach the $0.01907 mark, a 41% increase from its current price. Nervos Network (CKB) has shown tremendous growth on both the weekly and monthly charts, with gains of over 77.49% and 73.76%, respectively. Given its upward momentum and favorable technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Nervos Network (CKB) is on track to continue its bullish trend through the end of 2024. 2025 Price Prediction: Continued Adoption and Growth Looking ahead to 2025, Nervos Network (CKB) is expected to experience continued adoption as blockchain interoperability becomes a critical focus for developers. The coin’s price could see steady growth, potentially reaching $0.030 by mid-2025. Several factors will contribute to this growth, including the expansion of DeFi applications built on the Nervos blockchain and its integration with major platforms. Additionally, Nervos Network (CKB)’s partnership with Layer 2 solutions could boost its ecosystem, making it more appealing to developers and investors alike. By 2025, the Nervos Network (CKB) could solidify its position as one of the top Layer 1 blockchain projects, with potential price growth of over 100% from current levels. 2026 Price Prediction: Long-Term Potential for Massive Gains By 2026, Nervos Network (CKB) could see exponential growth as the broader cryptocurrency market matures and more investors recognize the potential of interoperable blockchains. Some analysts predict that Nervos Network (CKB) could reach $0.050 by the end of 2026, as institutional investors begin to take a greater interest in blockchain technology. One notable development in 2026 could be the continued accumulation of Nervos Network (CKB) by large holders, or “whales.” Many of these whales have already started adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their crypto bags, seeing the potential for massive gains in the meme coin space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an intriguing opportunity for CKB whales to diversify their portfolios, particularly as the token is set to launch its decentralized casino platform, combining meme culture with real-world utility. Conclusion: A Promising Future for CKB and Mpeppe Nervos Network (CKB) is well-positioned for strong growth in 2024, 2025, and 2026, driven by its focus on blockchain interoperability and the expansion of its ecosystem. With whales adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios, the two projects could offer significant gains for investors. Whether you’re interested in the long-term potential of Nervos Network (CKB) or the explosive upside of Mpeppe (MPEPE), these cryptocurrencies present exciting opportunities in the rapidly evolving crypto market.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Ethereum In Danger: Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Crash To $1,800",2024-09-16 15:00:14+00:00,"An analyst has explained how losing this on-chain demand zone could cause Ethereum to witness a crash to as low as $1,800. Ethereum Is Currently Retesting A Major On-Chain Support Zone In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about how Ethereum is looking like in terms of investor cost basis distribution right now, citing data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. In the above chart, the dots represent the amount of ETH that was last purchased by investors or addresses inside the corresponding price range. As is visible, the $2,292 to $2,359 range stands out in terms of the size of its dot, suggesting that some heavy buying had occurred between these levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Spikes After Mild Price Jump: Crowd Too Excited Too Quickly? More specifically, almost 52.3 million ETH was acquired by 1.9 million addresses inside this range. Since Ethereum is currently retesting the range, all these investors would be just breaking-even on their investment. To any investor, their cost basis is naturally an important level and thus, they may be more prone to making some kind of move when a retest of it happens. For ranges that host the acquisition level of only a small amount of holders, though, any reaction resulting from a retest isn’t anything too relevant for the wider market. In the case of price ranges that are huge demand zones, however, a retest can cause visible fluctuations in the asset’s price. The aforementioned Ethereum range naturally belongs to this category. As for how exactly a retest of a large demand zone would affect the cryptocurrency, the answer lies in investor psychology. Retests that take place from above, that is, of investors who were in profit just before the retest, generally produce a buying reaction in the market. This is because these holders may believe the asset will go up again in the future, so getting to buy more at their cost basis can appear like a profitable opportunity. As Ethereum is currently retesting the $2,292 to $2,359 range, it’s possible it may feel support and find a rebound. In the scenario that a break under it takes place, however, the cryptocurrency’s price may be in danger. From the chart, it’s apparent that the ranges below this demand zone only carry the cost basis of a small amount of investors, so they may not be able to prevent a further decline in the asset. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin Puell Multiple Finally Enters ‘Buy’ Territory “If this demand zone breaks, we could see a sell-off driving ETH toward $1,800,” notes the analyst. A drawdown to this level from the current price would mean a crash of more than 21% for the coin. It now remains to be seen how the Ethereum price will develop in the coming days and if the on-chain support zone will hold. ETH Price After retracing its recovery from the last few days, Ethereum is back at $2,300, which is inside the aforementioned price range.

Reddit,solana,Urgent: Malicious Extension Targeting Solana Reddit,2024-08-19 20:35:42,"Hey everyone, Meow from Jupiter here.

Wanted to bring to everyone's urgent attention a chrome extension that has appears to be targeting Reddit users called ""**Bull Checker**"". If you have this installed, please uninstall this right away.

This software has drained quite a few people already:

[https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830)

Users with this extension would interact with the dApps as per normal, **have the simulation show up as normal**, but have the possibility of their tokens being maliciously transferred to another wallet upon transaction completion.

For full technical details, refer to my post here:

[https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584)

We believe that many reddit users might have gotten exposure to this extension because of a few postings by u/solana_og got a ton of visibility (tho he appears to have edited away mention of this extension)

[https:\/\/x.com\/SlorgoftheSlugs\/status\/1825617566489817182](https://preview.redd.it/lrmjelrwcojd1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7923fb2662d2dff88add75e3f87877585523ae)

The same user has been promoting Bull Checker many many times on reddit over past 2 weeks, so we fear that many users would have seen it by now.

Extensions are especially tricky because they have access to read/write data across anything you visit, so please do not install anything you don't 100% trust.

https://preview.redd.it/zmpp7gg1kojd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6891dfdd0e7c72a498f7ee570c0bd13ffb05a88a

Besides this, I am very sure that there are other extensions out there, it is just that this one is probably the most prominent now till to the effective marketing.

It breaks our hearts to have some users have a large amount of their hard earned savings from years of hard degening get drained, so **please please please stay safe**!",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,solana,Spotting and avoiding crypto Solana scams 101,2024-09-16 15:44:14,"Crypto scams are increasingly common and can deceive even expert investors. Here are some tips on how to avoid them:

# Common Scams:

* **Token pre-sale / Investment schemes:** Scammers promise high ROI and request upfront fees, or upfront investment in a token with a promise of being “high-potential”.
* **Rug pulls and slow rugs:** Fraudulent projects that disappear after taking investors' money, some happen a few minutes after the launch, while slow rugs happen over a longer period of time (undefined).
* **Phishing scams:** Fake websites and emails designed to steal your login credentials.
* **Fake trading platforms:** Scam sites posing as legitimate exchanges to steal your deposit funds.

# How to avoid scams:

* Avoid projects with guaranteed profits.
* Investigate any project extensively before trading.
* Never share your private keys or seed phrases.
* If an opportunity seems too good to be true, it likely is.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,solana,What do you look for in a memecoin?,2024-09-16 00:21:20,"Hey everyone! As much as people like to talk their smack about the memecoin market, which I can fully understand, as it’s been extremely oversaturated with a lot of pnd’s, most of which trend straight to zero. 

However the 24h volume of memecoins on Solana alone today was $4.20 billion, and this is considered a slower period. 

Obviously there is still a lot of interest in memecoins, and I believe there is always an opportunity to find a gem, and make some insane gains.

I’m curious as to what you look for in a memecoin? What does it take for you to not just ape into a coin, but feel confident to lock it up for a few months and come back to a wild return? Appreciate all responses! Cheers 🍻",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
Reddit,solana,Looking for Pilot Study Participants in a Novel Information Platform,2024-09-16 10:44:56,"Hi everyone,

I’m a solo founder trying to tackle a tough problem: disinformation and bias. I don’t know about you, but I’ve often felt like the news isn’t always objective (to put it mildly). Journalists, scientists, and bloggers are often caught in a tough spot—they need to follow the money, which leads to clickbait, infotainment, and political propaganda. But what if there was a way to encourage people to be as accurate as possible instead?

That’s where **Belief Markets** comes in. It’s a platform where you can bet on answers to questions like ""Is there life on Mars?"" or ""Is politician X an honest person?"". The cool part is, there’s no need for a definite outcome like in prediction markets. It works more like a stock market—if you think an answer is undervalued, you buy shares, post evidence, and if others find your info convincing, the price will go up, and you can sell at a profit. The idea is that competition in the market will punish bias and reward accuracy. I believe this could really help solve a big problem: making news and information more objective.

I’ve spent months working on this, and after many late nights and challenges, the platform is finally live on the Solana Devnet. Now I need people like you to help test it out. Honestly, I’m nervous but also excited to see if others find this idea as compelling as I do.

I’d love your participation, and I’m grateful for any feedback—good or bad. I don’t know if I can offer big monetary rewards, but I’ll do my best to give something. Mostly, I’m just hoping to get people involved who are curious and want to help make this better.

If you're interested, send me a message since I can't post links here. No pressure on how much time you spend—any input is appreciated!

Thanks so much for your time!

Cheers!",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,solana,Is cryptocurrency based company ownership tracking a idea worth pursuing?,2024-09-15 15:04:31,"Hi,

I want to hear your feedback on the feasibility of this idea and if you believe it's worth anything. It's nothing set in stone, no coin i'm advertising, I'm trying to see if you believe this would work with crypto nowadays and if you believe it's worth looking into further:

I come from a lawtech background (Company in tech automating tasks that would oftentimes be reserved to legal profesions, usually on the border of what is considered to be a task for a lawyer vs a task that anybody can do given enough knowledge).

We started as a business registration company and one of the threads of ideas we've had internally is in regards to using tokens for governance and share representation in companies.

I know that there was quite a serious discussion regarding using crypto to tie to actual stocks on exchanges worldwide (NYSE, NASDAQ, Euronext, XSHG, etc), however it was faced with a lot of regulatory problems which ended up in making the projects often fail. Plus, most people weren't as interested as expected in using crypto to pretty much own the right to a security that you'd be able to own directly and be safer.

This applies to stocks or other securities that are listed on stock exchanges and are both regulated as well as easier to access somehwere else.

One of the foundational benefits of Cryptocurrency is that it's quite affordable now with the last couple of projects doing proof of timestamp and proof of stake, and they're safer (from a technical perspective) than many off-chain solutions, plus they have redundancy built in.

What we were discussing (as we don't see regulatory being an issue for us as we already have a background in that area, even if it takes time) was developing a Crowdfunding based system using cryptocurrency.

Number one, I personally see a huge potential in the small business investment space. There's currently almost no offering outside institutions (VC Funds, Crowdfunders that oftentimes have very complex processes and require vetting, etc) which makes it hard to access funds, and if you are a reasonably competent business owner that can generate a ROI of 3-4x in the next 3 years (which is reasonable for smaller businesses and more niche models), there's nobody to invest into you.

Now yes, the growdth potential of many of these businesses is smaller, but they're millions, unlike startups that inherently are limited only to verticals with a lot of request (Uber for example replaced the gigantic taxi market, Airbnb gave an alternative to the institutional hotels market, etc). So as a person that has invested in the past I am sometimes pissed I can't invest into smaller projects and try to differentiate over tens or hundreds of them to get over market average.

It's less hands off than with traditional stock exchanges but it can also bring larger ROI and if you temper in the risk, I believe the models are even less risky than many startups that got listed on stock exchanges. If you know a chef is popular in his community and you see proof of that, along with great history, you can be quite sure that if he opens a local restaurant he can have quite a good chance of being popular and attracting clients. It's a very simple business model that is also more stable in general. Plus the sums needed for success are smaller.

Now the concern with this is that many talented people lack money, and going back to point one, they don't have any low-risk costs that can cover them. If I have a family with children, I'm not going to risk going in debt to a bank, but I would love getting invested in, but maybe I lack the capital to do it. So I'm going to give up a great business model, when a great alternative would've been finding a way to crowdfund it. And crypto is a good way to do it.

Number two, you can always remove the intermediary without major downsides (meaning that in the worst case scenario the crowdfunding site goes into bankruptcy, you won't get to a situation where you don't know who funded you or it's hard for funders to get their money back), since the on-chain ledger can be respected by anybody, even outside the founding entity or the project developers.

So in short because I wrote a lot, what I propose is a form of stock management through crypto for small companies (valuation under 1M eur), targeted at small businesses. I'm going to need to write a few emails to national regulatory bodies but reading the law and previous court cases, there's almost no regulation in Romania.

Ofc some things will require KYC/KYB, but this is already something people got used with when dealing with CEX, so I personally believe people wouldn't mind if they would have to do KYC/KYB if they for example want to vote in the meeting of shareholders for various decisions. And they'd do it one time.

I know in the US, the SEC regulates the matter so I'm unable to opine there. What is certain is that a EU business can own a US one so that's one way to make it work, plus regulations oftentimes fit on solutions, so if you have a good one regulators will adapt.

I see crypto as able to cut the costs veeery much, I won't name coins but some have very little gas fees. The cost of dealing with this traditionally is larger than using a coin on the chain. Plus (depending on the chain) there is some great evidentiary data to help with both regulatory purposes and track changes in share owning.

Crypto is perfect for this in my opinion. What do you think though, do you believe this is something worth putting 100 hours into and \~1000 EUR researching?

Edit: To clarify, 1000 EUR + 100 hours is how much it'd take for me to pilot and test this, not to create a solution.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-15 23:36:34,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,solana,advice on managing risks,2024-09-14 14:28:14,"
i’ve started trading meme coins around 8 months ago. back then i was building my altcoin bag and decided to diversify it with some blue chip memes.
with time i started spending way more time in meme space and i enjoyed it. trading memes is probably the funniest and the most exciting thing i ever did. 
it somehow has all of the components i’m passionate about - memes, marketing, cultural events, politics etc. 
long story short - i’ve been trading memes for six months now (started with 1k meme bag) and my bag is at ath (~50k). i never cashed out any funds - i am comfortable with my irl job income so i always treated meme trading as a chance of either slowly building a significant amount of money or ride it to zero (which i would be ok with worst case scenario)
at the same time i heard to many stories of people round tripping in the previous bull run so i decided to set up an ambitious cash out target - 100k.

now the question- as i am halfway to my goal i wanna revisit the plan and here are two scenarios that i see 

1) sol is at 137 rn and i’m sitting in a good coins that would probably do 3-4x+ if sol goes back to ath.

2) market will find a way to fuck me so do i just cash out now?

so you see - i’m both greedy of missing out on a real life changing money (way higher then my goal)
but at the same time i’m starting to realize i got to the point where it would be mentally hard to round trip.

what would you do? and thanks x

Reddit,solana,📉 Traders to Avoid When Copy Trading on Solana:,2024-09-14 21:46:00,"1. Scalper Traders: Their trades typically last less than a minute, making it unprofitable to copy them with free copy trading bots due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)

2. Traders with Numerous Buys: If a trader makes more than 4-5 buys, it becomes challenging to manage money effectively. For instance, if you allocate 10% of your deposit per trade and the trader makes 7-9 buys of a scam token, you could lose 70-90% of your assets.

3. Mixed Token Traders: These traders receive tokens from other wallets and also purchase tokens themselves. Their profit and loss (PnL) on trades may be higher than yours due to tokens received from external sources.

4. Token snipers: These traders buy tokens at the start of their market appearance (first candle). Using free copy trading bots with them can lead to losses due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

This added layer of security makes it much more difficult for hackers to steal your funds, particularly useful for companies and groups of traders sharing the same funds. It only applies to funds kept outside of exchanges, as they don’t support multi-sig wallets.

# Benefits:

* **Stronger security:** Your funds remain safe even if one key is compromised.
* **Shared access:** Ideal for groups like families or businesses where multiple people need access.
* **Reduced theft risk:** A single stolen key is insufficient to access your funds.

Reddit,solana,Crypto trading signals on Solana: how to find and use them effectively,2024-09-13 01:10:45,"When to buy, sell, or hold a crypto is a tough decision to make, that’s why signals often provide entry points, take profit, and stop-loss levels based on different indicators. Here’s how to find and use these signals:

# Benefits of crypto trading signals:

* **Reduced emotional decision-making:** Signals can help minimize impulsive trading decisions.
* **Opportunity identification:** They offer insights into potential trades directly.
* **Improved trading rates:** Beneficial for both new and experienced traders, providing ideas that save time and effort.

# How to find quality signal providers:

* **Avoid unrealistic claims:** Be cautious of providers promising 100% accuracy, as these can be scammers trying to signal on scam tokens. Do not take at first-value the announced win rates, you should calculate your own win rates of signals / sources from your own statistics.
* **Look for proven records:** Choose providers with a verified track record and double-check their metrics with your own experimentation.
* **Check community feedback:** Research what other traders think of these sources by reading feedback in the community.

# Practical tips for effective use:

* **Verify signals:** Analyze and confirm signals before acting on them.
* **Start with demos:** Test signals with demo accounts or spreadsheets before trading real assets.
* **Understand macro basics:** Signals paired with a macro understanding will take you to a new level, take the time to master the fundamentals and find the right signals for your strategy.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

* Better security of your crypto wallet and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
* Protects your investments by adding multiple layers of security measures.
* Why would you not?

**Common threats and prevention:**

**Phishing Attacks:** Use strong passwords, avoid public WiFi, and ensure you're visiting the official links (websites and social media) to protect against phishing.

**Malware Threats:** Equip a good antivirus and malware detector to prevent malware from accessing your private keys.

**Keyloggers:** On PC, you can use Task Manager to detect if a keylogger is installed, some malware applications can automatically detect them too (like Malwarebytes).

**Browser Vulnerabilities:** Avoid storing sensitive data in general browsers, such as never save your passwords on the browser directly, save into a password manager (this way you don’t give away your passwords if you get hacked, look into Lastpass). Use hardware wallets and enable two-factor authentication too.

Laziness and time-saving are bad excuses for not enabling MFA, your trading success is worth it.

 🦞 Solana Boston

Solana Boston, the first-ever Solana city conference in the US, will take place on October 19, 2024, at the MIT Media Lab.

Hosted by Boston DAO and supported by the Solana Foundation, the event is a place for US-based developers to connect, learn, and grow together.

Happening just a month after Breakpoint, Solana Boston hopes to extend the momentum stateside.

[Speaker applications](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGOVuHKjYGpBAaaS_14IFkxjHsnlbD9dKNqlpSr-jbx5KHiQ/viewform?ref=blog.colosseum.org) are open now.

### 📅 Breakpoint Agenda

The Breakpoint agenda has been announced with sessions across three key themes:

**Left Curve:**  
This track focuses on culture and products, with a fireside chat between Raj Gokal and Balaji Srinivasan discussing the Solana Network State. 

Highlights include updates on Firedancer, a debate on Crypto East vs. West, and product keynotes from ecosystem founders like FP Lee of Sanctum and Siong of Jupiter.

**Right Curve:**  
A deep dive into tech, featuring sessions on sandwich-resistant AMMs, hands-on Solana Actions, blinks, and ZK compression. A major highlight will be Toly and Mert discussing Solana 2.0.

**Ecosystem Activation:**  
Connect with the community at ""The Pod,"" attend workshops, and level up Radar hackathon projects at the [Colosseum Arena](https://blog.colosseum.org/announcing-colosseums-hackathon-arena-at-solana-breakpoint-2024/).

### 🗳️ Blockworks MetaDAO Report

This report from Blockworks explores how MetaDAO leverages *futarchy* to improve governance, its early results, and the potential this governance model holds for DAOs seeking to align decision-making with financial incentives.

The futarchy protocol proposed by MetaDAO addresses a flaw in DAO governance: misaligned incentives and inefficient decision-making. 

By leveraging conditional markets, futarchy turns speculation into a tool that lets market participants ""bet"" on the outcome of proposals based on if they believe a decision will positively affect a token's market value. 

Traders evaluate the impact of a decision based on data rather than pure opinion or ideology. The outcome could lead to more value-driven decisions for DAOs. 

MetaDAO is pioneering this approach by directly applying it to its own governance, making it both a platform and a case study for futarchy-based decision-making.

However, this model is still in an experimental phase. 

With just \~$675k in market volume and 15 proposals, the liquidity and participation levels remain modest. Without sufficient trading volume and participation, the markets may not produce reliable signals, which is key to the success of futarchy. 

If successful, futarchy could not only improve DAO governance, but also attract wider adoption across Solana, particularly among organizations seeking more efficient decision-making processes.

### 🏦 The Finternet on Solana

The [Finternet](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1178.pdf?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is an initiative to create a global network of tokenized assets such as stablecoins, stocks, and NFTs where users can transact with anyone worldwide.

To support this goal, Solana Foundation has announced a $1M grant program for developers, founders, and policy professionals contributing to building the Finternet on Solana. 

Grants range from $1,000 to $10,000 and focus on areas like user applications, token management tools, authentication wallets, and the Unified Ledger infrastructure. 

[**Solana Foundation Finternet Instagrants**](https://earn.superteam.fun/grants/finternet-grants/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

### 💰 Solana Foundation RFPs

The Solana Foundation has announced two new RFPs aimed at driving the development of open source data tooling for the Solana blockchain, with up to $160,000 in available funding.

The **Solana Indexer Tooling RFP** offers $100,000 in funding to develop an open-source infrastructure solution for accessing real-time and historical data from Solana programs and accounts. 

Deliverables include a tool for indexing real-time and historical updates for a set of accounts and programs using Anchor IDLs with features like account tracking, program listeners, transaction indexes, and integration with the Luzid local validator.

The **Solana Discriminator Directory RFP** provides $60,000 in funding to create an open-source discriminator database, which aims to enable developers to interact with unknown deployed programs and parse their instructions. 

The goal is to build a comprehensive solution that simplifies how developers access and manage program discriminators on Solana, making it easier for them to work with programs whose details may not be fully known or accessible.

The proposed solution includes the development of an API that allows developers to fetch program discriminators and access a community-managed dataset. This dataset will allow users to upload discriminators making it available to others in a structured format.

Both RFPs are open for submissions until October 4, 2024.

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-12 13:57:32,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,solana,Dev’s Diary: my journey launching a successful memecoin ,2024-09-12 13:02:25,"I’ve been in this space for a long time. I’m a comedy screenwriter and love crypto. About five months ago I’ve been “investing “ on some memecoins. Yeah, you know why “investing”. 

During this time I saw many many bad things. Rug pulls, soft rugs, abandoned projects and false promises.

Also I think that almost all characters of memecoins lacks personality. You see the same images everywhere. 

So I think that there is a space for a new one that is REALLY fun. I have been writing for MAD and decided to quit the job and launch my own character.

My plan is to do the REAL thing. A character that will survive and last more than a pump and dump. We will have small movies every week with profissional actors doing the voices. 

It took me a lot of time to realize that I know about content but a successful project is much more than that.

So I researched a lot and gathered a team of 8 people. Now we have designers, tokenomics specialist, a manager, an artist for animations and a guy in contact with KOLs (i don’t know if we use them, so much horror stories about dumping at the followers).

I’ll try to make things different. Depending on the reaction at this post I’ll keep on posting and showing you stuff of the project. Hope you all enjoy! ",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

Are you staking solo? What’s your take on his proposal?

Reddit,ethereum,Can KYC Add Security Without Compromising Decentralization? 🤔 ,2024-09-16 19:18:52,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

Reddit,ethereum,A Comprehensive Guide: How To Calculate Your Celsius Losses (with examples!),2024-09-15 16:51:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,ethereum,Sharing my Fitness DApp project,2024-09-12 14:01:57,"Hey everyone! 👋  
I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! 🙌

Feel free to go through the repos:

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-08 23:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?

I'm curious about why there seem to be so few opportunities for junior smart contract developers.

Most of the companies are asking for 5 years of experience in blockchain and 5 years in front-end development.

1.

2. Etherscan: Although i can't get all the above information in the same api call, i can if i combine multiple endpoints, but they are limited to 10000 records which makes them unusable.
3. Tatum: They dont provide information regarding Internal transaction
4. Alchemy: They have this endpoint ""alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers"" which was kinda perfect but they dont give information regarding transaction status.

My questions are:

Does this affect price drastically over time? For example, I have a spreadsheet that calculates the amount at different market caps. Is this amount still accurate at a higher market cap? Or does this mean the value of the amount at different market caps will change over time because of token burning?

Reddit,ethereum,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. ",2024-08-27 13:36:33,"**Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

How can I find out how many coins different wallets hold? For example, with USDT, I can see that Binance holds the most coins.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin has changed my life and views,2024-09-16 22:12:08,"Through out my entire life I was very stressed over the economy and just about how it’s all going to shit. Food, housing, gas, and so forth are all going up yet our salaries are just staying at the same pace with just little pennies and dimes more. 

I was against Bitcoin in the beginning calling it a scam, watching the news on “crypto” and how people were losing their money and getting rugged. I honestly believed in just using the banks to make money and letting them handle all my investments only. I believed in just working all my life full time while trying to please my boss so I can keep getting paid in this world, I was basically living in fear due to the never ending inflation. 

This all changed when I decided one day to bite the bullet and fix my crummy life, make a change. I bought the Bitcoin standard. After researching about it , it all started to make sense to me, it started to make sense that “crypto” is not Bitcoin but an imitation of it, how all these eventually will go to zero! People were getting scammed because they were getting into the hype of buying coins and becoming millionaires just to end up getting scammed. I saved some extra money on the side after a lot of hustle and decided to put in some money into Bitcoin. During the bear market in February of 2023, Bitcoin fell a lot, I decided to buy 2 Bitcoins and hold this (Not on exchange, as I also seen exchanges just shut down) eventually my amount grew over the months. 

Today I am happy looking at this growth it has made. I feel more relaxed in life knowing what the game is now with currency of the world. My stressed are much better. Even if Bitcoin goes down, it’s alright because it will always come back.

This was the best decision I ever made.

The moral collapse is probably as large or larger than the economic collapse. Morality predates the economy after all.

It's a bit sad sometimes thinking about the state of things but yes, at least we have Bitcoin.

Reddit,bitcoin,How to properly store wallet.dat,2024-09-16 13:50:57,"Hi all,

I use an offline install of Bitcoin Core to store my coins. The private key is therefore encrypted inside the wallet.dat file. To access the coins, someone (me included) needs both the wallet.dat file and the associated passphrase.

To maintain a two-layers security, I store the passphrase and the wallet.dat file at different places, so if someone gets possession of any of the two, my coins are still safe.

While the passphrase is just a string of characters and can easily be written down on a sheet of paper, the wallet.dat can only be stored on some kind of drive, like a USB stick.

Drives, however, have a limited lifetime and end up losing data when left alone for a long time.

Therefore, how can I properly store my wallet.dat. In 15 years or so, when I want to spend bitcoins, how can I guarantee that the drive I stored my wallet.dat on still works.

If I just copy my wallet.dat on a USB stick, chances are that this stick will be unreadable in 15 years.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitwarden vs Proton vs KeePass,2024-09-16 15:44:52,"I am thinking of moving my passwords from keepass which has been pretty good so far to something like bitwarden which is more popular with crypto enthusiasts or with proton because they also have protonmail which looks cool and like to separate my emails and spam.

I like keepass because its offline. I looked at proton which allows you to make separate emails and passwords for each site you make an account on. I could do that with keepass but I like the intuitiveness of proton. The main reason to get a password manager is to secure passwords but what if proton or bitwarden get infiltrated or something. Should I stick with keepass or move on and to which password manager given I would pay for the premium for it too.

I would also like to hear what people have to say in terms of managing their passwords, emails, accounts with different sites and services like banks, work related stuff, personal, shopping, games...

also is it safe to copy and paste passwords or use autofills or to type it out.

If you guys or vets in the game be able to share how you secure your passwords, emails as well as into their own sections like personal shopping, personal hobbies, work, bank, crypto etc that'd be great. What kind of storage safe do you personally use to keep emergency password sheets, hardware wallet and whether to take it with you when traveling to work etc. Your own anecdotal instructions and experience is beneficial. as well as password bit and characters. Is 32 characters and just under 200 bits too much? and if not then should i use this method for all passwords from website shopping or online games where I dont buy things and not just exclusively for crypto stuff?

Edit:

So I am thinking of going with BitWarden but in terms of managing my emails, does bitwarden have such a thing like protonmail and if not should i stick with managing emails and passwords separately on bitwarden or exclusively use emails using protonmail. I also feel like it is more secure if i move away from gmail.

Reddit,bitcoin,Technical question about block reward,2024-09-15 15:06:05,"I have a simple question about the block reward and the halving event. Is there a reason that the halving happening every 4 years is setup in a singular event. Why the halving phenomena is not distributed within a 4 years span, each block reward is just a little bit less then the previous. The result would be the same, after each 4 years the block reward would cut in half. it would be a progressious halving phenomena instead of a discrete one. 

I didnt do the exact math but it would look like that.

Nov28, 2012. Block reward 25bitcoin.... the next block reward: 24.999 bitcoin.... the next block 24.998 etc....

Reddit,bitcoin,Title: Seeking Advice on Building a Stable Career & Saving in Bitcoin for the Long Term ,2024-09-15 13:33:11,"Hey Reddit,

I’m 18 and recently finished 12th grade in commerce, but I’ve realized that my real interests lie in tech and the world of Bitcoin. I’m at the beginning of my journey, aiming to build a career where I can make a good living and, at the same time, save and invest in Bitcoin consistently throughout my life. My long-term goal is to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible while ensuring financial stability.

Here are the main things I'm focusing on right now:

1. Education & Career in Tech: I’m considering pursuing a degree in computer science (likely a BCA) and focusing on areas like full-stack blockchain development, DeFi, and software engineering. I aim to get into big tech firms like Microsoft while also building a strong foundation in crypto/blockchain tech.


2. Starting Side Businesses: I plan to start an agency to educate people about Bitcoin and possibly create a YouTube channel around this. Any advice on what kind of content resonates best with crypto audiences or how to build authority in this space?


3. Consistent Bitcoin Investing: My strategy is to invest heavily in Bitcoin whenever possible. I plan to buy on dips and hold long-term. I’d like to learn more about strategies to earn Bitcoin on the side or maximize my investments.


4. Financial Discipline: I’m thinking about using a portion of my salary (once I start earning) to consistently buy Bitcoin, regardless of price, and save the rest for essentials and business growth.


5. Credit Building: Since I’m just starting out with a CIBIL score of -1, I plan to open an FD and get a credit card against it. Over time, I want to build my credit for better financial opportunities.



If anyone has suggestions or experiences they can share on how I can structure my career to make a good living while steadily growing my Bitcoin holdings, I’d love to hear it. Whether it’s advice on entering the tech/crypto space, side businesses, or managing my finances wisely, I’m all ears!

Thanks in advance for your help!

TL;DR: 18, planning a career in tech with a focus on blockchain, want to save/invest everything in Bitcoin for life. Looking for advice on building a stable career while consistently buying Bitcoin.

The trouble is, I literally never hear anyone IRL talk about crypto, unless it is to roll their eyes. Crypto, to the masses, is now passé. It was a gravy train that came, and went. That is why the price action has been so weak, in spite of ETFs and large scale institutional buying. There is no buzz at all around Bitcoin or crypto in the population generally. Nobody cares except for diamond hand hold outs like me, and degens gambling on sh!tcoins. I fear that if Bitcoin fails to fire in the coming months there will be a rising fear that the hitherto reliable cycle is broken and a rush to the exit will commence.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin big players only,2024-09-16 06:47:48,"I would like to make a base thesis for how I think the future of the Bitcoin network might work based on mining costs and transaction sizes. Eventually there will be no more block rewards and the network miners will operate only on fees paid by its users. Assuming people are ok with the credit card premium level of fee I used 3% for my calculations on a ballpark fee people might pay to move funds. I did a quick google and was able to find the Bitcoin network has about 4000 transactions per block. In order to make the same reward in USD terms as the miners make today we would need $6,000,000 moving in each block with a 3% fee which would yield a 180k fee (same as reward today). This means each transaction on average needs to be atleast $1500. 

Do you guys think bitcoin will only be used for the big players in the future and smaller people will have to use side chains or paper bitcoin from a 3rd party only? The alternative is people would have to pay $45 on average per transaction for anything they need to do (3% * $1500). 

Let me know if you would change any of the parameters above that would change how these equations might work! Maybe I’m missing an easy way to lower the average cost! ",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,bitcoin,A voting system weighted by Bitcoin holdings,2024-09-16 09:22:37,"Hello everyone, I'm here seeking some advice. I'm currently developing a website that uses Bitcoin signatures to verify wallet balances, allowing users to vote (or endorse) candidates based on their holdings. The concept is simple: users submit their wallet address and choose a candidate to support. The website then generates a plaintext message containing the candidate's name, which the user signs with their private key and returns the signature to the website. Once verified, the candidate receives a number of votes equivalent to the balance of that address. There's no need for registration, and no transactions are involved.

The reason I'm building this site is that I believe Bitcoin's narrative may extend beyond just being a store of value. By showcasing the address, plaintext, and signature, Bitcoiners can rally together to wield political influence. Large endorsements backed by significant balances will be hard to ignore. Although the evolution of this process may be complex, if Bitcoin endorsements gain recognition, I believe we could be on the path to world peace. Sometimes I even think this could represent the future of democracy. The underlying implication of ""one person, one vote"" is that brute force can rule, and while I respect that, I think proof-of-work-based voting might be a more rational alternative. Its implication is that those who provide what society needs should set the rules, and the more experienced and senior (usually) people should have more weight. In my vision, this website acts as a beacon, a signal sent from veteran Bitcoiners to guide the next generation.

However, when my father learned that I had found a team and started development, he expressed serious opposition. He believes the site won't make money and could cause trouble, as he doesn't want me caught in the storm of politics. When he discovered that I also plan to support voting on China leadership, he became outright angry.

I understand his concerns. This is indeed a thankless task; I could be sued, I could be imprisoned. But to not act out of fear would be like refusing to invent the lightbulb for fear of offending candle makers. Every time I think about how this could potentially push human civilization to the next level, I can't let go of the idea. Uniting Hodlers around the world to save humanity—this is a potential that no other asset in history has ever reached.

I know Bitcoin will do just fine without this application, but I still want to give it a try. If I succeed, we will save the world in the name of Bitcoin. And if I fail, at least it will serve as a foundation for future success.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,bitcoin,Why do bitcoin non believers bother me so much?,2024-09-15 16:56:03,"Just a little comment how and I’m sure this has been discussed before. 

You say something like, “you should devote at least 2% of your portfolio to owning some bitcoin.” Then you get some smug comment like:

“No thanks, I believe in banks.

 I am old fashioned. I only do savings and 401k

I will think about watching those video links on bitcoin - I am just not that interested! 

 I am understanding it - same way I feel about all the internet tools - and AI! 

I am more into following politics at the moment! 

It just seems sketch to me - I am kinda old fashioned - Luddite - !!

Haha yeah, dude when you get rich, just give me some!

I would get into that but I am broke!

That’s old fashioned, I have dogecoin!

Thats a scam!”



Most of these people have also 0 urgency of understanding what “usery” is or fractionalized banking is. They are so disturbingly tone deaf to inflation! They know something is wrong but yet they sit in the pot like a frog in water that is slowly being brought to a boil. 

I KNOW that I am an IDIOT for trying to simply tell some of my closest friends and family any financial advice and I may as well have tried to get them to join Amway or become a Kirby vacuum salesman.

And you know that most of the time when I’ve ever even brought this up, it’s because I heard them complaining about how they can’t afford this. Or they’re cutting back on this. Or they’re not taking a family vacation this year. Or they’re cooking at home more because eating out is too expensive. or complaining about gas prices. They are complaining about the cost of daycare. Or sending kids to college is breaking me financially.  

It shouldn’t shock me when some of these people own $4million dollar homes that look like crap and are in SanFrancisco with a bum sleeping or peeing/ pooping on their stoop everyday when they get home at 6pm from work & there’s a dude who made his nest in front their entryway, blocking their teens from entering their home… 

It’s like being skinny fat. They’re rich poor.

They just don’t see it!  It’s not my job to make them!  

I just got a part time job and keep stacking! I got more bitcoin than I ever imagined I could. I can sell it all right now and fully pay my house off but I am not interested in selling… i am accumulating. I have shut my mouth now towards everyone and stopped talking about it, now. I mostly change the subject now.

The greatest example of what I am trying to express to my fellow dear bitcoin family is for you to watch that movie: Don't Look Up!  Somebody needs to make bitcoin memes from that movie!

This is not meant to be a 1 to 1 comparison but simply a data point. 
Gold is currently ~$2,600/ounce.
It's estimated that there's 244,000 tons of mined gold in existence. 

Each ton is 32,000 ounces. 
So 32,000 x 244,000 x $2,600 is $20.3008 trillion 
If the total amount of bitcoin is 21 million, then  would mean each bitcoin is worth $966,704. 

Obviously this would mean a full transition of gold to bitcoin which is unrealistic but even if people continued to slowly migrate from gold to bitcoin with a 10% allocation then value would still be ~$96,000. 

If we take into Acct the estimate that 20% of all bitcoin burned then the value is $1.2m

My take from this is that there's additional upward potential. Especially if we get a major country central bank that starts to hold bitcoin.

Reddit,bitcoin,I Was Wrong ,2024-09-15 13:25:13,"How many people do you know that would be willing to say “I was wrong”? 

This is the hurdle for many new Bitcoiners. 
Investing in Bitcoin now, is to realise an imagined financial loss on a missed opportunity.

Maintaining a view that Bitcoin is unsafe or a scam or a bubble or will be banned, is much easier than realizing you could have retired by now. This is why these views will linger for some time yet.

As zoomers and unborn generations come through, they won’t face the ego barrier. As they will have no living price memory to anchor from. Similar to how a young first home buyer never thinks of the 1980s, 90s or 2000s house prices. They understand earlier prices but their ego is unscathed by them.

Corporations, institutions and nation states also don’t deal with mental anguish. Each time their leadership changes, the organizations memory is effectively wiped and starts a fresh.

Yes a person has to learn and “do the work” to understand Bitcoin. But before someone embarks on 100 hours of learning, the first step is to think “I might have been wrong”. 
Plenty of people can not do that.

[https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=CommunityCurrencyBot&subject=Balance%20Inquiry&message=Please%20show%20my%20Community%20Currency%20balances](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=CommunityCurrencyBot&subject=Balance%20Inquiry&message=Please%20show%20my%20Community%20Currency%20balances)

The balance displayed will be the amount of off chain Moons you have earned and are currently stored on the Community Currency Bot.

Note: Not all earned on-chain Moons are kept on the Bot, as a safeguard only a fraction of user earned Moons are available to withdraw on chain via the bot. The rest are stored in Multisig and the bot will be refilled as needed.

**----------**

# Tipping:

Do you see any content on r/cc that you particularly enjoy? If so leave them a tip by responding to either their post or their comment with the following format:

* !tip x

x = the amount of Moons you want to tip. The bot requires a minimum of 1. **Do not add other text to your comment when leaving a tip.**

**----------**

# Withdrawing off chain Moons from the Bot

Once you've earned Moons you are free to tip those Moons to other users in the off chain ecosystem, but if you want to get those Moons on chain you'll need to withdraw them from the bot.

You can type !withdraw x to withdraw Moons from the Bot and get them on chain in your vault.

If you get an error that you don't have a withdraw address registered or want to use a different address with the bot you can type:

* **!register** 0xCopy-paste-your-own-wallet address

Then try withdrawing again.

**When you withdraw Moons from the bot they will be sent to Arbitrum One not Arbirum Nova. This is due to the recent launch of Moons on Arbitrum One and the multi-sig being on Arb One.**

# rCryptoCurrency Special Membership

Did you burn Moons to mint an [rcc special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/)?

Send a message to the bot using [this template](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=CommunityCurrencyBot&subject=Subscription%20Activation&message=Please%20activate%20my%20memberships) to activate your special membership.

**Recently there was a bug that didn't activate the special membership on rcc this should have been fixed. If you are are still impacted by this error please leave a comment so I can forward your case to the bot dev.**",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

""Oh, [](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)—the digital Wild West where every new coin is the next big thing until it isn’t.

Everyone's a self-proclaimed ""crypto expert"" when Bitcoin goes up, but the moment the market dips, they become financial prophets of doom. The subreddit is a melting pot of moonshot promises, with posts oscillating between ""We're all gonna make it!"" and ""HODL for dear life!"" It's the only place where you'll find people calling a 90% drop ""a healthy correction"" and referring to their overpriced JPEGs as ""art.""

And let's not forget the endless sea of acronyms—FUD, HODL, DYOR—more jargon than an alien language, but somehow everyone pretends they know exactly what’s going on. Meanwhile, every other post screams about the imminent ""mass adoption"" that never quite seems to arrive. It’s as if [](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) exists in a parallel universe where everyone is either a millionaire-in-the-making or a bitter ex-investor who “totally saw it coming.

The outcome of this bet hinges on the UMA oracle, a token with a total market cap of 179 million USD, less than 20% of the bets at stake.",2024-09-16 07:33:54,"So, the Polymarket betting market on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election has ballooned to almost 1 billion USDC wagered (920,717,846 USDC as of writing)

The outcome in the event of a dispute will be decided by a vote of UMA token holders. The market cap of UMA is currently 179.6 million USD. And with as much money wagered as there is and a topic as contentious as this, it is almost certain that enough people will dispute any proposed outcome to trigger a vote.

Doesn't this represent an enormous security risk, seeing as someone needs only spend 180 million USD to manipulate a betting market worth nearly 1 billion USD?

Of course, I am aware that any attempt to actually acquire this many UMA tokens to gain control of the oracle would likely result in a sharp increase in the price of UMA, but it remains a concern that at least must be theoretically addressed.

UMA's website claims ""over 1.25 billion USD in value secured"". If that claim is true, this single betting market would represent nearly half of the total ""value"" secured by UMA, ever.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Where will the liquidity come from that will spark the bull run this cycle?,2024-09-16 16:00:43,"There has been an enormous amount of speculation that the US / world will enter a major recession in 2025. To be fair, I have seen calls for an ""historic recession"" since 2012, so I'm always skeptical when I see these claims by ""experts.""


However, I do think a lot about the economic landscape today as compared to the bull run of 2021. Back then, people were locked down, staying at home, and receiving stimulus checks and unemployment benefits, which they spent on entertainment. At that time, Magic the Gathering / tabletop games / video games and consoles were selling at record numbers, and many states enacted temporary rent relief laws that prevented people from being evicted even if they could not pay. Liquidity was high and the markets were awash in excess cash. Gambling sites made record profits. Risk-on assets sold like hot cakes. Bubbles, bubbles everywhere.


Today is a pretty different situation: we've got a housing market squeeze / bubble that might be at the precipice of bursting (but again, remember those 2012 calls for a collapse). The labor markets have cooled significantly, and inflation has driven up COL / housing / groceries enormously. Everyday people - retail fish, as we call them in crypto - do not have the excess disposable cash they did a few years ago. Globally, there is a gigantic Chinese elephant in the room that looks ready to give up the ghost entirely, and more generally a worldwide population that appears reticent to spend money on anything but the essentials.


By now the crypto space has seen the effect of banks and asset management firms jumping into crypto: very little real price movement. It seems that retail, not corporate whales, is the true hope of degens for a massive run up.


What is the argument for a bull run this cycle besides ""it always happens""? Do the bulls expect fed rate cuts to provide the liquidity needed to stimulate risk-on asset buying? 


By the way, I know that a lot of people are hinging their bull run optimism on the irresistibly handsome, super-genius, incredibly emotionally mature, piously truth-telling, and [psychologically VERY stable](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/15/g-s1-23115/trump-taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement) presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the election and creating a federal BTC reserve fund. But I daresay, there's about a zero-percent chance he actually does that. So imagine a situation in which he loses or wins but doesn't create the fund, at least for a few years.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,There is no 1.4 trillion dollar stimulus headed to bitcoin from China.,2024-09-15 14:48:25,"So, let's use a bit of common sense as we move into this topic. A speculative Forbes article says, ""Maybe china is going to give its people 1000 USD each to go out and spend to get the economy moving again.""               

Okay. Let's break that down. 1000 USD / Person in China. Do you know how difficult it is to put that money into bitcoin if you live anywhere besides Hong Kong?               

Not to sound like a psy-op or a puppet from a foreign state, but it's necessary to name some reminders about China and digital assets:              
1. Ownership is prohibited.                  
2. Manufacturing of mining devices (ASICs) is prohibited (bitmain makes them in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia).              
3. Mining is illegal.                  
4. Using any payment method (wechat pay, alipay, bank transfer, etc.) to buy crypto is illegal.                   

Now, the above points will not stop everyone from buying crypto in China, but even before ""crypto-prohibition"" in China became a thing in 2021, crypto-ownership in China was lower per capita than America or Europe. A sober perspective is to say that maybe a billion or two USD will enter the crypto markets, largely through OTC trades - which are still very punishable and can get anyone's wechatpay / bank / alipay accounts suspended or restricted.               

So, in other words, at best, a few drops in the bucket will enter the market.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Navigating Egypt's Economic Restrictions: Friend Asking for Help with Receiving Money, Seeking Advice on Business Solutions",2024-09-16 15:33:11,"
I need some advice on a situation I’m dealing with. A friend from Egypt, who I’ve known for a while and trust, told me they are having trouble receiving money via PayPal, bank transfer or Western Union. They mentioned that due to the economic crisis in Egypt, there are restrictions in place that only allow them to receive money from immediate family members.

Because of this, they suggested an alternative. They asked if I could receive the money for them via PayPal, since I’m based in Europe, and then send it to them using cryptocurrency, which apparently is easier for them to receive. For context I am receiving money for their freelancing services which they offer online. To be honest I have known the Egyptian friend for a while and do trust them. I am more worried about a customer trying to scam them and me ending caught up in that situation. I already received the money from the customer on paypal. My main concern is that the buyer could request a refund through PayPal after I’ve already sent the money via crypto. In that case, I would just ask my friend in Egypt to return the money, but I want to avoid getting caught in a tricky situation. Also the amount isn't super high. So I also wouldn't have to register a company or pay taxes on it myself. I already checked that

Another thing I'm wondering about is whether it would be possible for my friend to register a company in Germany. I’m not sure what the restrictions are for Egyptians registering businesses abroad, and if this could help them solve the problem in a more stable way. I'm sure there is a better solution for everyone involved. And since the friend works as a freelancer full time I'm sure there's a better solution. I know about people from abroad registering companys in the UK and stuff like that. Im also not sure why something like upwork or Fiverr wouldn't work 

Lastly, I’m trying to understand more about this ""economic crisis"" they mentioned. What exactly is happening in Egypt right now that’s causing these restrictions? Is there any long-term solution to this, or is it something that’s likely to continue? I’m also curious if there could be some tax-related aspect to this, and whether this approach (crypto payments) might have something to do with that.

I’d appreciate any insights or advice on this situation!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Drops to Lowest Since April 2021. Here’s Why It Matters,2024-09-16 18:32:37,"https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/09/16/ether-bitcoin-ratio-drops-to-lowest-since-april-2021-heres-why-it-matters/



The ETH/BTC ratio has hit its lowest since April 2021, dipping below 0.04, signaling a decline in investor interest in ether relative to bitcoin.
The preference has swung towards bitcoin, which was influenced by the introduction of bitcoin ETFs, which saw significant inflows compared to ether ETFs experiencing net outflows.
Some traders say this shift indicates a broader market favoring bitcoin's perceived stability over ether's riskier, high-yield potential.
Analysts suggest the ETH/BTC ratio might drop further, potentially to the 0.02-0.03 range, unless there's a significant change in investor sentiment or regulatory clarity that might favor riskier assets like altcoins.

A closely watched ratio tracking the relative price strength of ether (ETH) against bitcoin (BTC) has dropped to its lowest level since April 2021, indicative of a fallout in investor demand for the world’s second-largest token.
The ether-bitcoin trading pair fell under 0.04 late Sunday to trade at 0.039 in European morning hours Monday, extending year-to-date losses to nearly 30%. Although colloquially called a ratio - ETH/BTC is simply the trading pair of ether against bitcoin on crypto exchanges, which attracts hundreds of millions in daily volumes.

Over the past five years, the ETH/BTC ratio has risen from 0.02 to a peak of above 0.08 in early 2022 - meaning ETH had quadrupled in value relative to BTC at the time.
Its value proposition has been on the decline ever since - bitcoin set fresh lifetime highs in April in U.S. dollars (before tumbling 20%), while ether is yet to break its highs from 2021 and is down 52% from its 2021 peak. Year-to-date, bitcoin has returned over 40% to investors while ether holders have gained just under 1%.

Meanwhile, traders such as Kuptsikevich see further pain ahead for those betting on the ETH/BTC ratio.
“This ratio has the potential to fall further into the 0.02-0.03 range. This is surprising given the generally positive investor sentiment towards altcoins a few months after the BTC halving and the generally higher beta of altcoins to the stock market, which has been quite strong in recent months,” he noted.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,A message to paper hands in crypto! Keep selling in the red and keep buying in the green. I need to make gains. I got kids to feed!,2024-09-16 16:31:59,"As the title says, paper hands are the reason why I'm happy with crypto. I love crypto, I made over 100k$ in a year out of 30k$. Last year at this time when Avax was 7$, I was watching the paper hands on Avalanche sub complaining about the tokenomics and inflation while Avax was upgrading and working hard. I sold at 30$ and made more than 3x in a short time, since then I managed my money right and always kept dcaing in and out. I never traded short term, it was always on 1w timeframe and I made gains, in a month I make 10k(that's a lot in my town), in another month don't make much profits depending on crashes and opportunities but keep in mind that buy in red sell in green, buy when there's fear consuming the market, sell when your grandma talks about crypto. I personally put 30% of my whole cash I have in Ldo Link Ada and Dot and I'm expecting 3x here(70% is cash on hw waiting for real crisis)

While there were people complaining , I was stacking, there was fud about everything including btc, there were people claiming that btc would go down to 100$, I never listened and since I was tight on budget, I had to go all in and that was the last mistake I ever ever ever made in my entire life(even though I got lucky and made gains.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Thoughts on the Rate Cut this Wednesday?,2024-09-16 07:32:01,"So as the Fed is meeting tomorrow Tuesday and then releasing their decision this Wednesday the following day, I think we can safely assume a rate cate has been confirmed with 90-99% confidence

Anyway my curiosity is what we’re all thinking the rate cut will be? I personally suspect is could be 0.50 rate cute despite reading a lot of stuff that indicates people who are more appropriately in the know that me see a near certainty that it will 0.25 as 0.50 would rock the boat too much. 

I personally think we’re on path towards a recession and a 0.50 fed rate cut has (according to what I read) almost always followed with a recession, so this is why I’m suspecting this. That being said apparently a bigger rate cut 0.50 as opposed to 0.25 would cause a fair bit of havoc and selling off whereas as a smaller rate cut would be more stable - I don’t know how true this is so would love input 

If I’m being honest though I don’t really see another sell of and think this Wednesday is about to kick off the next part of this cycle and leave this bottom in the dust

I'm one of these Cardano investors who was trading very happily with ADA until the crash that stuck us on the 0.35-0.45$ area. Welp, that sucks.

So despite my very calm investing strategy is to analyze trendings and wait for the price to reach what I expect, I have to accept that ADA is very unlikely to recover the ""golden age"" it once had. And despite I'm not one of these who put their life savings in crypto, it still sucks.

**So, what strategy would you follow in my situiation? I'm interesting on hearing your thoughs.** 

On average, I bought Cardano at a price of **1.51$.** For the time being I have a trailing order that triggers at 1.5$, as I would be happy enough if I recover what I invested. 

As an investor I try to avoid high risk options such as futures. I like to simply buy low, place a trailing order to sell, wait for the notification to execute, trailing order to buy lower, rince and repeat.

What would you do?

As my basis for measurement, I’m analysing data from this subreddit. There generally tends to be less hype and very little (to no) memecoin shilling, so it’s a fairly clean dataset in that respect.

The bot takes into account post titles and post descriptions from the Hot. The bot is Open Source and can even place trades on sentiment signals, I'll leave a link to GitHub down below.

Without further ado: here are today’s Sentiment Values, I’ll keep it nice and short.

The sentiment values range between -1 and 1, with -1 being extremely negative and 1 being extremely positive. I’ve also highlighted the cells so defining notable thresholds.

On average, the sentiment seems fairly positive, however altcoins seem to have a more positive sentiment than Bitcoin, which sits at 0.17. This is only slightly positive.

Ethereum is a bit more positive with 0.29 but still relatively reserved.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Introducing the Doom Olympics a 7-day gaming competition with $15,000 in prizes. Powered by RIVES (an onchain gaming console) a Cartesi Roll-Up + an AMA and Cartesi Swag Giveaway",2024-09-14 00:18:39,"Hello, [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/), we're excited to be here for another AMA!

This time, we are excited to introduce you to one of the dApps developed with Cartesi Rollups: RIVES, an onchain fantasy console that runs retro games and programs entirely onchain, enabling every element—from gameplay to interactions—to be fully verifiable.

RIVES started by bringing verifiable DOOM onchain, and since then, the team has developed an entire game console with a custom emulator that is verifiable onchain. It enables creating, verifying, and distributing of small expressive games called cartridges. By verifying gameplays, the platform creates tapes (replayable onchain gameplay logs) and adds players to immutable leaderboards. The platform has launched on mainnet this week with a gaming competition, the first of its kind - The DOOM Olympics: a 7-day event with 7 unique contests (or disciplines) using the Freedoom build. This contest takes place between September 12 and 20, with $15,000 in prizes. We'll be here to answer questions for an AMA tomorrow, September 14th, from 1 pm UTC until around 3 pm UTC. Ask questions about RIVES/Cartesi

# About Cartesi 

[Cartesi](https://cartesi.io/) is a powerful modular blockchain protocol that supercharges the web3 space. It equips developers with access to a full Linux environment through its native virtual machine, and high-performance rollups designed to support next-generation dApps.

Cartesi’s mission is to expand what is possible in Web3 and unlock the power of decentralization by allowing developers access to existing tools and libraries to build more efficiently, as well as a dedicated CPU for their dApp, avoiding competition for blockspace while maintaining the security guarantees of the base layer. Cartesi Rollups can be deployed as L2, L3 (on top of Optimism, Arbitrum, Base etc.), or sovereign rollups. Learn more and explore use cases enabled by Cartesi here: [https://cartesi.io/usecases/](https://cartesi.io/usecases/)

# Introducing RIVES built with Cartesi Rollups

[RIVES](https://rives.io/) (which stands for **RISC-V Verifiable Entertainment System**) is an onchain fantasy console that allows creating, distributing, and playing of cartridges (small programs), and tapes (verified interactions).

Unlike most Web3 games or platforms, RIVES leans into blockchain capabilities to the fullest. Not only are the assets onchain, but also the game logic and state, unlocking new possibilities. RIVES can run complex games like DOOM fully verifiably. Gameplays/scores (e.g., speedruns) can be verified and proven without intermediaries and stored in history forever. On top of this, it enables new forms of modding and composability.

# DOOM Olympics

The DOOM Olympics is a 7-day DOOM competition on RIVES where players partake in 7 different DOOM contests/disciplines. The 7 contests are: Lightning Run, Knuckle Crusher, Infallible Aim, Secret Master, Treasure Seeker, The Completionist, Enemy Eradicator.

Each contest features its unique scoring system and set of objectives. Each gameplay runs locally in the browser within the same Cartesi VM and is verifiable on-chain. Players generate tapes—verified gameplay and interaction logs—using cartridges (small games), such as the DOOM cartridge in this case. After the player submits their logs to the RIVES rollup for verification, the nodes execute the same deterministic Cartesi VM, thereby securing them a spot on the leaderboard in a verifiable, transparent, and cheat-resistant manner.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Is there a risk of allowing degenerancy of bilinear pairings in the case of the Groth16 zk‑snark system ?

For that reason, Zcash makes this a requirement and provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

password + salt -> bcrypt -> stored password hash & salt value in db

when user login, will use bcrypt on the plaintext password and the stored salt value to make sure the hash match with the one in database.

file encryption:  
generate pbkdf2 derived password from main password + salt value (the same one in db) -> this derived key then be used for aes file encryption / decryption key

For the sake of simplicity, I am using the same salt value in the database for both authentication and pdkdf2 aes key generation, I think it's safe, just wanted a second opinion. Thanks",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,crypto,Falcon vs. Dilithium vs. SPHINCS+,2024-08-30 17:39:49,"What do you believe is the best choice.

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

This is more of a Falcon vs. Dilithium post as they seem to be the more commonly used.

Why should I prefer Dilithium over Falcon? Any opinions?",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Reddit,crypto,"Seeking Feedback and Security Assessment for My New Encryption Method ""FlexCrypt""",2024-08-18 18:44:29,"I’ve developed a new encryption method called **FlexCrypt** and I would greatly appreciate your feedback and security assessment. FlexCrypt combines several techniques, including hex pair reversal, permutation-based encryption, and XOR encryption. Below are the details:

# How Does FlexCrypt Work?

1. **Hex Reversal**: The plaintext is first converted into a hexadecimal format, and then the hex pairs are reversed.
2. **Permutation of Hex Pairs**: Using a permutation key (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]), the hex pairs are randomly rearranged.
3. **XOR Encryption**: Finally, the rearranged hex text is encrypted using a 128-bit XOR key. This key length can be increased to 192 or 256 bits for enhanced security.

# Example:

* **Plaintext**: ""Hello World!""
* **Encrypted Text**: ""f7b72d60""
* **Decrypted Text**: ""Hello World!""

# Key Management

* **XOR Key**: A 128-bit key used for XOR encryption (with the option to increase to 192 or 256 bits).
* **Permutation Key**: A key that determines the order of the hex pairs (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]).

# Questions for the Community:

1. How do you assess the security and efficiency of FlexCrypt compared to established methods like AES?
2. Are there any vulnerabilities or attack vectors that I might have overlooked?
3. Under what conditions could FlexCrypt be practically applied?

# Challenge:

Here are some encrypted texts using FlexCrypt. I’d like to challenge the community to see if you can crack them:

* **Challenge 1:** 9bf4ac1a0917d41df90f (128 bit)
* **Challenge 2:** 0ed819acd9856bbf67b15b12 (192bit)
* **Challenge 3:** 9918da0ef57306502b5b (256bit)

Feel free to share your attempts and findings!

Originally I was told to refer to the Intel Manuals to learn more about cryptographic hardware extensions.

However I admit I have no experience in hardware RTL designs nor assembly. Plus Intel CPUs are proprietary and I can't just make edits to them without risking lawsuits (or worse). So I decided to pay attention to the RISC-V Cryptographic Hardware Extensions--which are open source.

Reddit,crypto,The commitments in Groth16 never get opened!,2024-08-16 11:53:39,"[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) uses something very similar to KZG commitments (the Powers of Tau in a trusted setup & use of Elliptic Curve Pairings), though the paper doesn't mention KZG at all. 

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);
        record.start_size_header(2);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 17:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

    G = (

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

Reddit,crypto,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",2024-07-24 16:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈).",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032

Reddit,crypto,Is the Usage of RSA Decreasing?,2024-07-21 21:31:20,"I have seen Reddit posts here cursing RSA before.

Is the usage of RSA decreasing with time as we all expect it too?

We expect post-quantum, timing attack-resistant programs to replace them.

Is there valid reason to believe this is the case based on the data we have. If so what data are you drawing from and how did you draw the conclusion.

If not why not with a similiar analysis.",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
Reddit,crypto,What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,2024-07-21 12:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;
    },

Reddit,crypto,To All Cryptographic Engineers -- Would You Do It Again?,2024-07-20 20:25:28,"To All Employed Cryptographic Engineers in this subreddit,

I am considering joining cryptographic engineering teams at work.

Since some of you have far more experience developing crypto code at work than I do I wanted to ask:

Writing your own crypto code is discouraged. Why did you get started and how did you build your skills?

Would you do it again?

What are the biggest issues you face as a cryptographic engineer?

Are there any frequent work problems you deal with when working with others?

What is the part of being a crypto developer that you enjoyed the most?

I thank everyone who takes the time to respond!",2024-09-17 00:42:43.097032
