This bearish movement has seen an increasing number of investors being moved into the red as the price drops. If this continues, then the ETH price could fall below $2,000 again. But there is still a possibility for a reversal as a bullish pattern has formed on the Ethereum price chart. Ethereum Falling Wedge Pattern Appears With the recent decline in price, there has been the formation of a falling wedge pattern for the Ethereum cryptocurrency, Now, with the rebound from its lows, this pattern has neared its completion, meaning the next steps will begin soon. Related Reading: XRP Price To $100: Why Has It Not Hit This Price Yet? Crypto analyst CobraVanguard pointed this out in an analysis on TradingView which highlighted the falling wedge pattern. This pattern, while it can be quite bullish for an asset, it can also be very bearish for the Ethereum price. So, the crypto analyst outlines the two possible scenarios for the altcoin’s price. The first of these scenarios is a breakout from the falling wedge pattern that has formed on the 1-Day timeframe. If this breakout happens, then the Ethereum price could rocket from here. In addition to this, the crypto analyst has also outlined a bullish divergence on the MACD for the Ethereum price, which lends credence to a possible breakout from the falling wedge pattern. However, on the flip side, where the price does not break out from this pattern, the cryptocurrency’s price is expected to fall. This is due to the mounting bearish pressure on the second-largest crypto by market cap as large holders continue sell-offs over the last month. Also, the analyst explains that the fifth wave could end up playing out, something that could push the price even higher. Where Can The ETH Price Go From Here? The bullish scenario following a breakout is especially important for the Ethereum price as it could put an end to the bearishness that has rocked the price. In the analysis, the crypto analyst outlines that a breakout from here would send the ETH price as high as $3,000, which is a more than 30% increase from here. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Extended Consolidation Or A Break Below/Above? However, if there is a breakdown in the price, then the Ethereum price could be seeing another decline below $2,000. The analyst’s chart puts the altcoin price as low as $1,778.

Let’s explore why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing attention and whether Dogecoin (DOGE) can withstand the current market challenges. Dogecoin’s Bearish Trend: Will DOGE Rebound or Continue to Struggle? Dogecoin (DOGE), once a leading meme coin, has experienced considerable volatility in recent months.

Why Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Casino and Mobile Gaming Features Are So Attractive to DOGE Whales One of the key reasons Dogecoin (DOGE) whales are adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios is the latter’s focus on mobile gaming and casino platforms. Unlike many traditional meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers actual utility through its gaming and gambling ecosystem. Players can earn and use MPEPE tokens across various De-Fi platforms, allowing them to participate in yield farming, staking, and liquidity mining while engaging in thrilling online games and betting. Why Meme Coins Like Mpeppe (MPEPE) Appeal to Investors Meme cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are notorious for their speculative nature, adding an element of excitement and risk that many crypto investors find appealing. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has capitalized on this by combining viral marketing with tangible use cases, making it more than just a hype-driven token.

Recently, some of the largest Uniswap (UNI) investors have begun accumulating new and promising Ethereum-based meme coins, hoping to capitalize on potential 100X gains. Among the standout contenders is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a memecoin merging sports fandom with blockchain technology. As Uniswap (UNI) continues to perform well despite broader market challenges, the addition of Mpeppe (MPEPE) to whale investors’ portfolios suggests there’s significant belief in the future success of this memecoin. Uniswap (UNI): Resilience Amid Market Challenges Uniswap (UNI) has been a standout performer this month, defying the bearish trends affecting much of the crypto market. With its price up 16% in September and an impressive 45% year-to-date, Uniswap (UNI) continues to cement its position as one of the most successful decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap (UNI) allows users to trade tokens without the need for intermediaries, making it an essential tool for investors seeking decentralized trading solutions. Despite these gains, Uniswap (UNI) is still down over 85% from its all-time high (ATH) in May 2021. This significant decline has left some investors wondering when UNI will recover to its previous highs. However, whale investors have started to accumulate tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), indicating they see potential in smaller, innovative projects to fuel future growth. These whales’ optimism suggests that while Uniswap (UNI) may be down from its ATH, it’s far from out of the race. Why Whales Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) is one of the latest memecoins capturing the attention of the crypto community. Built on Ethereum, Mpeppe combines the excitement of sports fandom with the viral power of meme culture. Inspired by Pepecoin and the soccer sensation Kylian Mbappé, Mpeppe offers much more than just meme appeal. It’s creating an entire ecosystem for decentralized gaming, sports betting, and unique Player Card NFTs, positioning itself as a major player in both the meme and GambleFi sectors. Whale investors on Uniswap (UNI) are taking notice of Mpeppe’s potential, particularly because of its strong community backing and unique utility. The token’s presale has already seen more than 1.6 billion tokens sold, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down.

Uniswap (UNI) Whale Strategy: Betting on the Next Big Memecoins Whale investors on Uniswap (UNI) are known for making strategic moves in the crypto market, often setting the tone for broader market sentiment. Their interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) and other Ethereum-based memecoins highlights their belief in the potential for massive gains. Uniswap (UNI) offers the perfect platform for these investors to access such opportunities, providing the liquidity and ease of trading that whales need to execute large transactions efficiently.

Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its innovative approach and strong presale performance, is high on their radar. These investors are banking on the possibility that projects like Mpeppe could yield 100X returns, just as early adopters of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu saw astronomical gains in the past. The Continued Performance of Uniswap (UNI) While Uniswap (UNI) whales are diversifying into new memecoins, it’s important to note that Uniswap itself has performed admirably in a challenging market. With its price up 16% this month, Uniswap (UNI) has shown resilience that few other tokens can match. Its role as a decentralized exchange on Ethereum means that it continues to attract a wide variety of users, from retail traders to large-scale investors. Uniswap’s (UNI) current price of $4.50 may be well below its ATH, but its year-to-date performance demonstrates strong fundamentals. As more memecoins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) gain popularity, Uniswap (UNI) stands to benefit from increased trading volume on its platform. The connection between whale activity and Uniswap’s (UNI) performance highlights the importance of the DEX in shaping the future of crypto markets. Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Uniswap (UNI): A Winning Combination? The strategic moves by Uniswap (UNI) whale investors to accumulate Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlight a growing trend in the cryptocurrency space: the rise of innovative memecoins with real utility. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is creating a decentralized gaming and sports betting ecosystem that goes beyond simple speculation, offering users the chance to participate in real-world activities and earn rewards. This unique blend of utility and meme appeal makes it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Uniswap (UNI), as one of the largest decentralized exchanges, plays a critical role in facilitating access to projects like Mpeppe. Its ability to provide liquidity and low fees ensures that investors can easily trade tokens like Mpeppe, helping these projects gain traction in the market. Conclusion: Uniswap (UNI) Whales See Potential in Mpeppe (MPEPE) As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Uniswap (UNI) whale investors are positioning themselves for potential 100X gains by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios. With Uniswap (UNI) remaining one of the best-performing cryptos this month, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) making waves in the meme and GambleFi sectors, the combination of these two projects could prove to be a winning strategy.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Uniswap Settles Major Charges As New Cryptocurrency Casino Prepares Uniswap Launch,2024-09-09 14:00:12+00:00,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) world continues to expand as new projects leverage the power of Ethereum’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Recently, Uniswap (UNI) has seen a significant uptick in trading volume, driven by both its settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the anticipation of new projects launching on its platform. One such project is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a cryptocurrency casino that is gearing up for its debut on Uniswap, and investors are already anticipating major gains. Uniswap (UNI) and the Rise in Ethereum DEX Volume Uniswap (UNI) is one of the most successful decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Following its settlement with the CFTC, Uniswap saw its transaction volume rise by 14.2% to $5.7 billion. This surge came during a period of market retreat, where other DEX platforms like Solana and Tron experienced declines in activity. Uniswap’s ability to maintain robust transaction volume, even amid market volatility, reinforces its position as a key player in the DeFi space. The settlement with the CFTC required Uniswap to pay a $175,000 fine and halt its margin products in the U.S. This move removed some regulatory uncertainty around the platform, allowing Uniswap (UNI) to regain the trust of its users and rebuild momentum. The company’s trading volume increase in recent weeks reflects this renewed investor confidence. Along with Uniswap (UNI), other Ethereum DEXs like Curve Finance and Balancer also experienced significant volume growth, further indicating a resurgence in DeFi activity. As Ethereum (ETH) remains the dominant blockchain for decentralized finance, the continued growth of platforms like Uniswap (UNI) suggests a bright future for innovative projects launching on these platforms, including Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Casino Platform for the DeFi Generation Mpeppe (MPEPE) is an Ethereum-based meme coin with a unique twist—it’s also a fully functioning decentralized casino platform. Inspired by the viral appeal of meme coins like Pepecoin and the world of sports betting, Mpeppe aims to revolutionize online gambling by creating a transparent, fair, and decentralized casino experience. Built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) will allow users to participate in various gaming and betting activities while earning rewards through staking and liquidity provision. The platform’s decentralized nature ensures that all transactions are transparent, recorded on the blockchain, and immune to manipulation. With its upcoming launch on Uniswap (UNI), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is generating significant buzz among both meme coin enthusiasts and investors interested in decentralized gambling platforms. The project’s innovative blend of fun and functionality positions it to capture a significant share of the growing GambleFi sector, where users seek opportunities to earn while enjoying online games and betting. The Impact of Uniswap’s (UNI) Settlement and Growth Uniswap’s (UNI) recent settlement with the CFTC has cleared a significant regulatory hurdle for the platform. The settlement allowed Uniswap to address legal challenges while continuing to operate as one of the largest decentralized exchanges on Ethereum (ETH). This regulatory clarity has been a key factor in the platform’s volume surge, as investors feel more confident in Uniswap’s ability to navigate potential legal obstacles. The surge in Ethereum (ETH) DEX volume has positioned Uniswap (UNI) as a leader in the DeFi space. Alongside Uniswap’s growth, Ethereum (ETH) itself has remained a dominant force, facilitating over $9.88 billion in DEX transactions, far outpacing other blockchains like Solana and Tron.

With its unique offering of decentralized gambling and the viral potential of meme coins, Mpeppe is positioned to become a standout project in the crypto space. Early investors are eyeing Uniswap (UNI) as the ideal platform for Mpeppe’s launch, given Uniswap’s large user base and liquidity. As Ethereum (ETH) remains the dominant blockchain for DeFi projects, Mpeppe’s decision to launch on Uniswap (UNI) aligns with its goal of capturing a broad audience. The project’s presale has already generated significant interest, and with Uniswap’s (UNI) increased volume, the launch is expected to attract even more attention. Conclusion As Uniswap (UNI) settles major regulatory charges and its transaction volume surges, the stage is set for new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to make a significant impact. Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead the DeFi space, and Uniswap’s (UNI) platform remains a critical hub for innovative decentralized applications.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,ETH Price Analysis: Uniswap (UNI) Investors Join Mpeppe Casino Ahead Of Uniswap Launch,2024-09-09 14:00:08+00:00,"Uniswap (UNI) whale investors, in particular, are making waves by adding new Ethereum-based meme coins to their portfolios, such as Mpeppe (MPEPE), as they prepare for future launches on the Uniswap decentralized exchange. With Uniswap’s proven success and Mpeppe’s innovative ecosystem, these investors hope to capitalize on the growing meme coin trend, positioning themselves for potentially massive gains. Uniswap (UNI): A Leader in Decentralized Finance Uniswap (UNI) has long been a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. As one of the most successful decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum, it allows users to trade various tokens without intermediaries, driving the concept of permissionless trading. Uniswap (UNI) has maintained its position as a top performer despite the broader market struggles. In early September 2024, Uniswap (UNI) was among the top three altcoin gainers, with a weekly price increase of 8%, driven by key developments and market interest. Uniswap (UNI) benefited from a major regulatory settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which helped boost investor confidence. This regulatory clarity contributed to UNI’s price surge to $6.40 before settling slightly lower at $6.22. Despite this dip, the token remains well-positioned for future growth, especially as investors look forward to new opportunities in the DeFi and meme coin sectors. The Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Meme Coin with Real Utility While Uniswap (UNI) continues to be a critical player in the DeFi ecosystem, some of its whale investors are turning their attention to emerging meme coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE).

Meme coins have a track record of delivering massive returns for early investors. Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu saw explosive growth, transforming small investments into substantial gains. Many believe that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could follow a similar trajectory, especially given its blend of meme appeal and practical use cases. The excitement surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not only driven by its meme coin status but also by its ecosystem.

Following a sharp decline, AVAX has surged more than 18% since hitting a low of $20.5 on September 6 and is now showing signs of strength as it flirts with higher prices.  Related Reading: Can AVAX Reclaim $30? Top Analyst Predicts A Dip Before A Bounce This recovery has sparked optimism among top investors and analysts, many of whom are positioning themselves for the next potential rally. Analysts share their views on social media, suggesting that AVAX could soon target even higher levels, with an optimistic target above $28.  This shift in sentiment marks a significant change from the previous bearish outlook as AVAX continues attracting attention from retail and institutional players. As the market evolves, all eyes are on Avalanche to see if it can maintain this bullish momentum and reach new price levels. Avalanche Showing Strength In Higher Time Frames Avalanche (AVAX) has been one of the most affected altcoins over the past few months, enduring a 73% decline from its March highs. Despite this significant drop, top analysts and investors are now predicting a reversal, with many expecting a swift recovery for this Layer-1 blockchain.  One of the leading voices is Daan, a prominent crypto trader and investor, who recently shared his analysis of AVAX’s price structure on X. He highlighted that AVAX has established a higher low, which could signal the beginning of a bullish trend if it breaks past the key $28 resistance level. According to Daan’s analysis, this break would indicate a shift in market structure from bearish to bullish. If the price moves beyond $28, it could quickly target the low-$30 price range. Should AVAX reclaim these levels, investors could anticipate an aggressive upward move as demand builds, similar to the momentum seen in last year’s October-November surge. Daan also noted that such a move could lead to an influx of buyers, creating substantial demand that would further drive the price higher. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rally Brewing? On-Chain Metrics Suggest Investors Optimism With growing optimism around AVAX, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout. Many see the $28 level as the critical point determining whether AVAX can sustain this upward momentum and potentially initiate a new rally. AVAX Price Action  AVAX trades at $23.82, following an 18% surge from local lows. The price has recently moved above the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $23.23, a critical strength indicator in shorter time frames. A sustained uptrend could form in the short term when the price is above this level and maintained as support. This shift has sparked renewed optimism among traders and investors. For bulls to maintain control and continue pushing AVAX higher, the price must break past the local high of $28.01. A successful move above this resistance could lead to further upward momentum, potentially targeting higher price ranges in the days ahead. However, if AVAX fails to break above this key resistance level, the price may face a pullback, likely retesting the lower demand zone near $20, which has served as strong support during recent corrections.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Toncoin (TON) Latest News: Analyst Breaks Down The Affects Telegram CEO Arrest Has Made and Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Benefited,2024-09-09 13:00:25+00:00,"The arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has had ripple effects across the cryptocurrency market, especially for Toncoin (TON). While the event shook the Toncoin (TON) ecosystem, another meme cryptocurrency, Mpeppe (MPEPE), managed to capitalize on the situation. Let’s dive into the aftermath of this incident and how Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained traction. Telegram CEO’s Arrest Sends Shockwaves Through the Toncoin (TON) Ecosystem The arrest of Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov sent Toncoin (TON) investors into a state of uncertainty. As a project closely associated with Telegram, Toncoin (TON) faced backlash from investors who feared the impact this event could have on its long-term viability. The arrest led to a 10% drop in TON’s value, which raised concerns about the future of the network. Toncoin’s Struggles Lead to Investor Exodus With growing concerns about Toncoin (TON), many investors started diversifying their portfolios, moving away from Toncoin (TON) to avoid potential long-term risks. As they sought alternatives, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stood out as an attractive option, particularly for those seeking decentralized, community-driven projects. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Benefited from Toncoin’s Struggles While Toncoin (TON) was hit hard by its connection to Telegram, Mpeppe (MPEPE) thrived in a decentralized environment. As a meme cryptocurrency not reliant on any single entity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presented itself as a more stable investment during uncertain times. This difference in structure between the two projects was a major factor in Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rise. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Decentralized Meme Coin with Utility Unlike Toncoin (TON), which is closely tied to Telegram, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a fully decentralized meme coin with real-world utility. It leverages decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, offering features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and governance mechanisms. These functionalities have given Mpeppe (MPEPE) a competitive edge in the market. Toncoin’s Centralization Concerns Versus Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Community-Driven Approach One of the key issues raised after the Toncoin (TON) debacle was its connection to Telegram and its leadership. Investors began to see the risks associated with centralized projects, and Mpeppe (MPEPE), being community-driven, offered a more appealing alternative. This decentralized governance helped reassure investors seeking more transparent and secure opportunities in the crypto space. Conclusion: Will Mpeppe (MPEPE) Continue to Dominate? As the cryptocurrency market adjusts to the fallout from Telegram’s CEO’s arrest, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a surprising beneficiary. While Toncoin (TON) grapples with its challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE)‘s decentralized approach, community-driven focus, and expanding use cases make it a project to watch closely. Investors looking for a stable and promising meme coin in the wake of Toncoin (TON)’s struggles may find Mpeppe (MPEPE) to be the perfect fit.  For more information on the Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale:  Visit Mpeppe (MPEPE) Join and become a community member:  https://t.me/mpeppecoin https://x.com/mpeppecommunity?s=11&t=hQv3guBuxfglZI-0YOTGuQ",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,$120M Trading Volume Hits Starknet As New Ethereum Cryptocurrencies STRK & Mpeppe Generate Profits,2024-09-09 13:00:15+00:00,"The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, and two projects making headlines are Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both projects have caught the attention of traders and investors, especially after the recent surge in trading volume that hit the Starknet (STRK) ecosystem. With over $120 million in trading activity, Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe have become focal points for Ethereum investors looking for gains in an otherwise bearish market. Starknet’s Recent Performance: A Major Gainer in September Starknet (STRK) has been one of the standout performers in the first week of September 2024. The Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution saw its token rise by 7% recently, continuing its upward trajectory with a cumulative 19% increase over the past week. Starknet (STRK) utilizes zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-STARKs) to improve Ethereum’s scalability, allowing the network to handle more transactions at lower costs while maintaining security. A key development that sparked interest in Starknet (STRK) was Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s move to transfer over 2 million STRK tokens to a new wallet. This action drew significant market attention, pushing STRK to trade at $0.43 after briefly dipping to $0.39. The transfer reinforced Starknet (STRK)’s position as a promising Ethereum-based solution, reigniting investor confidence in the project. From a technical standpoint, Starknet (STRK)’s recent price movements have been supported by bullish indicators. The Bull Bear Power (BBP) metric shows that buying pressure has once again overtaken selling pressure, indicating the possibility of further gains. Additionally, Starknet (STRK) has broken above a descending trendline, suggesting that its bullish momentum could continue. If sustained, Starknet (STRK) could see its price climb to $0.48, according to market analysts. However, it faces a key support level at $0.35, and a drop below this threshold could result in a more significant decline. Mpeppe: The Rising Star of Decentralized Casinos While Starknet (STRK) is gaining traction in the Ethereum scaling space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing attention in the meme coin and decentralized finance sectors, particularly through its innovative online casino platform. Built on Ethereum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers more than just speculative trading its decentralized casino platform provides real utility, allowing users to participate in provably fair gaming while earning staking rewards. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s decentralized casino operates with the transparency and security that blockchain technology provides, offering a unique proposition in the rapidly growing GambleFi space. Investors are not only attracted by the token’s meme coin appeal but also by the promise of long-term profitability through the platform’s revenue-sharing model. With its presale already nearing completion, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is set to launch its casino platform soon, giving token holders the opportunity to earn passive income through staking and profit-sharing mechanisms. The excitement surrounding the project has led to significant buy-in from Ethereum (ETH) whale investors, positioning Mpeppe (MPEPE) as one of the most promising projects in the decentralized casino sector. Ethereum Investors Eye Profits in Starknet and Mpeppe Ethereum (ETH) whale investors are taking advantage of the opportunities presented by both Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). With Starknet (STRK)’s advanced layer-2 scaling capabilities and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s decentralized casino platform, both projects are seen as high-potential investments in the current market. The recent surge in Starknet (STRK)’s trading volume is a clear indication that investors are beginning to take notice of the project’s long-term potential. Similarly, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to decentralized gambling has attracted attention from those looking for real utility in the meme coin space. Both Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) (MPEPE) have distinct value propositions that set them apart in the crowded crypto market. Starknet (STRK) is providing a much-needed solution to Ethereum’s scalability issues, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is bringing a new dimension to the online gambling industry with its decentralized, transparent platform. As a result, both projects are becoming popular choices for Ethereum investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. Conclusion: Starknet and Mpeppe Leading the Charge As the broader cryptocurrency market remains relatively quiet, Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging as top contenders for Ethereum investors. Starknet’s layer-2 scaling solution has demonstrated strong technical performance, supported by bullish indicators and increased trading volume. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s decentralized casino platform offers real-world utility in the rapidly growing GambleFi sector, making it a standout in the meme coin space. With over $120 million in trading volume hitting Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale nearing its conclusion, both projects are poised to generate significant profits for early investors. As Ethereum whale investors continue to move into these projects, Starknet (STRK) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are well-positioned to deliver substantial returns in the coming months.

Reddit,solana,Urgent: Malicious Extension Targeting Solana Reddit,2024-08-20 00:35:42,"Hey everyone, Meow from Jupiter here.

Wanted to bring to everyone's urgent attention a chrome extension that has appears to be targeting Reddit users called ""**Bull Checker**"". If you have this installed, please uninstall this right away.

This software has drained quite a few people already:

[https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830)

Users with this extension would interact with the dApps as per normal, **have the simulation show up as normal**, but have the possibility of their tokens being maliciously transferred to another wallet upon transaction completion.

For full technical details, refer to my post here:

[https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584)

We believe that many reddit users might have gotten exposure to this extension because of a few postings by u/solana_og got a ton of visibility (tho he appears to have edited away mention of this extension)

[https:\/\/x.com\/SlorgoftheSlugs\/status\/1825617566489817182](https://preview.redd.it/lrmjelrwcojd1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7923fb2662d2dff88add75e3f87877585523ae)

The same user has been promoting Bull Checker many many times on reddit over past 2 weeks, so we fear that many users would have seen it by now.

Extensions are especially tricky because they have access to read/write data across anything you visit, so please do not install anything you don't 100% trust.

https://preview.redd.it/zmpp7gg1kojd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6891dfdd0e7c72a498f7ee570c0bd13ffb05a88a

Besides this, I am very sure that there are other extensions out there, it is just that this one is probably the most prominent now till to the effective marketing.

It breaks our hearts to have some users have a large amount of their hard earned savings from years of hard degening get drained, so **please please please stay safe**!",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,solana,Why auto downloads are risky on Solana,2024-09-09 05:53:55,"No wallet, no way to interact with the blockchain or with an exchange (CEX or DEX). Imagine if simply downloading an image can drain your crypto wallet?

Automatic downloads on messaging apps can compromise your private keys and drain your crypto wallets if they contain malicious code. They can also expose your device to malware. By avoiding auto-downloads, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access and hackers.

Phishing attacks pose another threat to your crypto journey. Cybercriminals create fake sites and apps that mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Auto-downloads can install these malicious apps, compromising your wallet. Verify the authenticity of any site or app before downloading and disable auto-downloads on all devices.

# How to protect your crypto wallet

1. **Disable auto-downloads on all devices and applications:** Do not skip this step!
2. **Use a hardware wallet:** For optimal security, store your private keys offline with a hardware wallet. A small step to protect a bit more against online threats.
3. **Choose reputable crypto exchanges:** Research every platform before selecting an exchange (both CEX and DEX) that you like, some have a bigger history of losing customer funds than others.

Reddit,solana,Help! What do we think about this chain of transactions on the solana blockchain?Scam or scam? xD,2024-09-08 17:26:24,"Hi so, I am the victim here. A guy convinced me to send some Solana to my Trust wallet on the Sol network.

[Here ](https://solscan.io/account/FVZHcGLLBtQUGHyGoQDc5JGViUGyJj6r8oGMSEYro6ba#transfers)is the account involved and the transactions.  
What do you think?

He said we are bridging from Fantom (where I supposedly had some wbtc). I would need to deposit solana and i'd get this ETH on Solana. 

Red flags:

- I don't see the bridge (I don't understand much though)

- the transfers of this address are weird.. much of my SOL goes to [this ](https://solscan.io/account/AwQAxJVJx3KVe567FgX6reUa6BEgcyrWFd7gcTRh8xpy)address where it seems to be spent on crap. (play flip gg wtf?)

- this "" ETH""  token is actually [this ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-ethereum-sollet)one which seems to be a semi-dead coin, lost parity with ETH, selling for 350 a piece; the wallet shows the value of a real eth but on the address it's not!

So.. help me out, how is the scammer doing this? It is sooo shady. I have lost some money already, I would not want to lose more.

Reddit,solana,Is anyone here an admin/mod of a Discord community on Solana?,2024-09-08 16:33:57,"Hey everyone,  
I tend to see a lot of Discord communities emerge for projects on Solana. I have personally also been involved with Discord crypto communities since a long time ago and I also have some experience building Discord bots.

As part of the recent [Blinkathon](https://blinkathon.fun) hackathon I have built the [Blinkord](https://blinkord.com) platform - Solana Blinks meet Discord. It's a platform where Discord server owners can create their own shareable link and enable their community members to gain access to paid/exclusive content in only a few clicks and through Solana's Blinks, which can be done from anywhere.

The point of Blinkord is to replace the need for using centralized platforms to offer premium content on Discord and make it very easy for the community members to obtain exclusive roles which grant them access, highly increasing the conversion rate for the purchases.

It is currently in the MVP phase and I am trying to get as much feedback as possible to validate my idea and also to see if there is enough demand from Discord server admins or mods to use such a tool to offer premium content to their community members.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback and would love to hear your thoughts, thanks!!

I got tired of missing out on the latest PumpFun graduates hitting Raydium, so I built a Telegram bot to keep me in the loop. Thought some of you might find it useful too.

Here's what it does:

🚀 Instant alerts when tokens jump from PumpFun to Raydium

📊 Rankings of the top launches every 4 hours

🧠 No shill, just on-chain data

I was blown away when I realized only about 1% of PumpFun tokens make it to Raydium, and even fewer survive 24 hours. This bot helps me spot them as soon as they launch.

It's been a game-changer for my own trading, so I figured I'd share it with the community. If you want to check it out, just search for MemeToolsAlertBot on Telegram.

Reddit,solana,URL previews and verifying links before clicking for Solana crypto safety,2024-09-07 18:17:56,"Solana trading is already risky enough as our asset class is very speculative and high in movement, the worst would be to also fall victim to scams due to a lack of attention to security. 

A simple way to avoid getting scammed is to be very cautious about the links you click. The basis of scams in crypto is often designed to exploit your desire for a quick buck and carelessness.

To avoid significant financial losses, pay attention for a few minutes and keep your wallet intact by being vigilant and taking proactive steps.



Here's a guide to help you protect yourself with unknown links:

**Unknown links are not your friends**

Your favorite and other known trading crypto bots are often impersonated by fake bots. If you don’t double-check the right link/username for a trading bot, you’re likely to send your funds somewhere that doesn’t belong to you, or at least with the capacity to return these assets back to yourself. 

Avoid clicking on every link you come across, as doing so could lead to your personal information being compromised or even your computer being infiltrated with malware. With one click, a ton can happen. Do not underestimate the impact of one click. Prioritize security to protect your investments above all.



**Using token scanners and explorers**

To verify the legitimacy of a token and its official links, use tools like token sniffers and blockchain explorers to preview the legit URLs, allowing you to trade the right smart contract and follow the right social media profiles.



**CEXs and DEXs can be impersonated too**

Even if you have used a platform a thousand times, make sure to bookmark the legit URLs of the platforms you use to avoid ever giving your login information to a fake website pretending to be the exchange you use. Bookmarking URLs is an easy practice to keep you safe.

Reddit,solana,"Solana meme token traders, do you stay away from some established tokens because of their holders?
",2024-09-06 19:52:19,"I have been trading meme tokens on Solana for a while now, on my own, and I did, overall, fairly well. Mostly I never buy coins right after launch, or if I do, I buy because I have some reason to (I have my own script to track good and bad wallets).

Recently I noticed that there are 2-3 wallets which regularly destroy charts, even though they do not necessarily seem involved with the developers (even though they might be, behind the scenes). As a result I am staying away from coins I like, with decent communities and decent market caps, because these wallets are holding them.

I know with these highly volatile speculative tokens you are always one step away from losing it all, but I think risk mitigation can help you especially because you are playing a rigged game. Do you normally stay away from decent tokens if a bad wallet holds a significant part of the supply? I recently sold some coins I like because these wallets were holding them. 

I tried to post some of the wallets I am avoiding, but auto moderation won't let me.

Anyhow, what strategies do you use in these cases?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,solana,New way to scam | Gib.work.,2024-09-06 09:50:25,"At first the platform started giving rewards for tasks to claim it you just needed to pay gas fee.

Later they introduced platform fee in the background and started charging more sol than what you make per task. Their claim is that our token will be worth more later so pay us the higher fee now. looks like a new way of scam.

This has been happening to all the users and none of them have noticed the fee yet. so they are blindly doing tasks and losing their money every time they hit claim reward.

here's their Solscan: [https://solscan.io/account/8LvZVZejYgd2EU84M9odAHhYoVHmC8Sb8zz5VWxhDtLV](https://solscan.io/account/8LvZVZejYgd2EU84M9odAHhYoVHmC8Sb8zz5VWxhDtLV)

Edit: The main issue here is that they didn't communicate the introduction of the platform fee and the so-called ""platform fee"" is 5 times more than the earned reward. It's like doing a task worth 1 USD and paying 5 USD to claim that 1 USD. You are just giving them 4 USD while doing the task for free.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

### 🎧 Listen to This

### Validated

In this episode, Austin chats with Jon Wong (Solana Foundation) and Chris Osborn (Dialect) about the development of and use cases for Blinks and Solana Actions.

Blinks, short for ""blockchain links,"" allow users to take direct ""Actions"" on the Solana blockchain such as swapping tokens, donating, or voting on governance directly from a link on platforms like X.

The conversation highlights the rapid adoption and excitement within the developer community around these new features, the security model ensuring safe transactions, and the future potential for mobile integration and expanding Blinks’ functionality across other web platforms.

I naturally panicked and relentlessly tried to figure out where the funds went. I tried refreshing the wallet in exodus and still missing the balance.

As a last ditch effort I tried to restore the wallet into a different wallet app all together and BOOM.. my Sol tokens reappeared.

Turns out: both wallets were showing 2 different public addresses to the SAME private key but exodus was only showing me the balance on one public address and not all of the tokens the private key actually held.

Has anyone else experience this? Am I being a noob??

Reddit,solana,"Bullruns: Past and Now, The death of Solana and ETH",2024-09-06 00:58:42,"I wanted to make this post in regards for the crypto community in general. There’s too many sheep. In the past bullruns were dictated by the BTC liquidations. From btc into eth into alt coins. Now, it’s completely different. This bullrun is shaped by the ETFs. There is barely any liquidation into eth. Why do you think it’s tested the 2.8k 9 TIMES AND FAILED? It’s pisspoor technology and Solana will die along with it. Solana lies about their numbers, it’s full of scams, and the worst is it’s full of idiots. No other chain is comprised of “oh yea let me put money into this coin I know nothing about and get rugged 😃” anyways, if Solana doesn’t CLEAN the bullshit from the real it will never survive. It will gain a bad reputation after mass crypto adoption and that will be the end of it. You can bring the numbers up all you want but reputation is more important. War is a display of deception. So if you think this bullrun is “for” the altcoins, you’re painfully wrong. It’s the exact opposite. It’s the death of meme and shitty altcoins. Things like dogecoin will survive because it’s lived its battle. Bitcoin became bitcoin through a DECADE of battling. COVID and mtgox leaks. It’s a movement. Can you destroy a movement, something you can’t touch? I can destroy numbers but not ideas. Btc will reach 130-180 in 2025, eth will hit 4-6k and then late 2025, will begin its very slow death… and then Solana.

I started staking through Phantom several months ago and my supposed 7% APY return got me only pennies. I staked over 23 SOL. I restaked recently with a new validator and just like the last one my rewards drop. I’ve never staked another token that had diminishing returns. I understand the value can drop but why do the rewards decrease? Even Trustwallet got me actual returns as much of a nightmare that platform was. I’d never go back to that, as I don’t trust “trust” wallet at all. All the research led me to Phantom, but after 4-5 months of staking I’ve gotten less than $1 USD worth of SOL, and I’m staking over $3,000 USD in value. ",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

One thing I don't understand in this example is these couple of strange trades ([https://imgur.com/a/az5Iajc](https://imgur.com/a/az5Iajc)).

See how first the liquidity is added to a Raydium LP. Then there are several trades. And then those two traders interact with an unknown platform by swapping 25 and 5 SOLs for this new token at a much lower price (nearly 10x lower) than the actual price in the Raydium's pool. How is that even possible? Is that some custom Program with its own pool that just has a different ratio of SOL/token deposited there?

Reddit,solana,Mevx Review - Defillama to the Top Out of Nowhere or Is It SoltradingBot? (gem research),2024-09-04 11:52:38,"In terms of daily revenue, a new platform for trading memes in the Solana network has appeared in the top of Defillama. Mevx ranks 4th in terms of Revenue 24h, while overtaking Pump.fun. Previously, similar platforms could not achieve this and pump fun was always ahead.

https://preview.redd.it/dtf8oclzzqmd1.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=cac44d436c3c092d4aff8fb16c0c313cc76c6d3e

In this article I will tell you about several coincidences that point to a future partnership or reorganization of one project and transition to Mevx. This project is called [Soltradingbot](https://soltradingbot.com/) . 

# Mevx daughter of stbot?

Soltradingbot has been on the market for a long time, it has big profits, a large audience and an established reputation. This project also has a token, stbot, you can take the contract from its official website. 

Proofs about the audience, volumes and income - [here](https://dune.com/whale_hunter/sol-trading-bot) , the info seems to be different from what is in defillama, but this link is indicated in the project's docs

All developers understand that the telegram bot has its advantages and disadvantages. I will not talk about it in more detail now, I will just note that the main disadvantage is the speed of requests to the Solana network. In the telegram bot, it slows down, because the bot is an interlayer. People noted other web platforms as faster, but it is not about optimizing work with the Solana network or using WSOL, it is about the telegram and bots.

In general, all the logical prerequisites are there for creating a web platform, unless of course the project wants to die in a couple of quarters or a year.

# Soltradingbot is this?

This is probably the third largest meme trading bot after Trojan and Bonkbot, many callers are using it. Overall, the project has a good reputation.

Stbot is a project token, the marketcap now (August 2024) is about 2 million dollars. The token itself is not popular, it has no utility and nothing is written about it. Here I carry out a small research and hint at future, **possible** , announcements.

# List of interesting coincidences

**1 match** - project layout, use of similar UX UI buttons.

Stbot made an announcement of the announcement))) as it usually happens, there will be revenue share soon, no details, but that's not the point. 

In this video we see a button with the same design as on Mevx\*  
\*there is a slight glare in the video, so the color is a little different, but visually there is a great similarity in any case.

**2 match** - video on youtube Mevx

In the first video that Mevx releases, in the first frame after the intro we see Soltradingbot ( [proof](https://youtu.be/qVUaSw6yPwM?t=4) ). In another video we can also see how a person inserts a contract of the stbot

stbot is a super unpopular token, so to randomly detect it and show it a couple of times... well, I doubt it

**3 match** - active links to Mevx appeared in the stbo

Again, this is a young platform, without a reputation, literally yesterday they appeared and the stbot starts to flood its competitor's audience? Hmm, why?

**4 coincidence or almost a statement** - on Twitter (former X) there is a connection between the Soltradingbot and Mevx accounts

# Is it a connection between the developers or is it one person?

https://preview.redd.it/4c4qdo340rmd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bab5970083ad1dc1efa0a3bb1f246ae7376487a

Source -  [https://dune.com/mevxbot/test](https://dune.com/mevxbot/test) , number of people in the bot 526,025

Now we go to dune stbot and check the number of people on the same date  [https://dune.com/whale\_hunter/sol-trading-bot](https://dune.com/whale_hunter/sol-trading-bot)

At least dune was converted from stbot to mevx, they forgot to clean up the data

# Thoughts and conclusion

I won't try to persuade you to buy stbot, I just hold it myself and post my research. There are no guarantees that tomorrow stbot will announce a rebranding or a merger and it will be Mevx

But why do such strange manipulations and literally tell us about the connection of these projects if nothing will happen after that? I don’t believe in such coincidences, so as a HODLer I increase the expected take profits and hope for cool announcements from the project.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

The Secure Wallet Import feature is absolutely brilliant. As someone who's used multiple hot wallets in the past, I'm tired of the constant hassle of transferring funds between different platforms and dealing with those annoying browser pop-ups and token approval dialogs.

With TokenSight, it's all just so seamless. I imported my existing hot wallet in literally a minute, and now I can trade across any supported chain without any fuss. The best part is that it's fully self-custodial, so I always have complete control over my funds.

If you're looking to simplify your trading life and boost your on-chain game, I highly recommend giving TokenSight a try. It's a must-have for any serious crypto trader.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,solana,Solana Dodges a Bullet: Major Validator Vulnerability Patched,2024-09-03 17:34:55,"Solana community! 🌞

A recent post-mortem dropped some 🔥 details on a critical vulnerability that was silently patched in Solana validators. This nasty bug could've taken down the entire network if left unchecked. Massive kudos to the entire core team and giga chads at Agave for swift execution. 

The TL;DR:

* Found in Agave and Jito validators
* Potential for network-wide shutdown
* Stealthily fixed before public reveal
* 67% of validators patched pre-announcement

The culprit? A sneaky assumption about address alignment in the SVM's CALL\_REG opcode implementation.

Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-09 03:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

I recently got a Trezor and want to self custody funds, however I'd also like to convert to rETH to get some APY. I've been doing some research and learning the basics, though there is a lot of info to take in here and trying to figure out what's best, and how to not accidentally screw myself and lose any coin in the process.



Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?

Reddit,ethereum,Why Aren't There More Junior Smart Contract Developer Positions? ,2024-09-05 23:53:59,"
I'm curious about why there seem to be so few opportunities for junior smart contract developers.

I understand that smart contract development requires a solid understanding of blockchain and security pitfalls, but if companies aren't offering junior roles, how are developers supposed to gain that experience?

I've been searching for opportunities for the last 2 months, but there are literally zero openings for entry-level positions. 

Most of the companies are asking for 5 years of experience in blockchain and 5 years in front-end development.

How can people who are just starting to learn this technology stay motivated if there are no opportunities to break into the field?

What can juniors do to bridge this gap and get their foot in the door?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

3. Any internal (Call) transactions.
4. Gives status of the transaction (Weather it was successfull or not)
5. Denomination of the token involved (contract address, symbol, decimal, logo)

I have tested following providers:

1. Moralis: They have the perfect endpoint that i was looking for (Moralis.EvmApi.wallets.getWalletHistory) but they are not providing correct information or even missing information in the transactions. They also dont provide the state of transaction, so even if the transaction has failed they provide the data as if the transaction happened.
2. Etherscan: Although i can't get all the above information in the same api call, i can if i combine multiple endpoints, but they are limited to 10000 records which makes them unusable.
3. Tatum: They dont provide information regarding Internal transaction
4. Alchemy: They have this endpoint ""alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers"" which was kinda perfect but they dont give information regarding transaction status.

Reddit,ethereum,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. ",2024-08-27 17:36:33,"**Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

I currently hold ( Amount) in ETH with an average cost of $2340. I've run into some financial issues (layoff/exhausted unemployment) and am hoping to liquidate some of my holdings to sustain myself and my family.

My question is, if I hypothetically sold $1000 profit per withdrawal and left my principal deposit dollar amount untouched, is this a smart tactic for DCA'ing out? Also, will withdrawing $1000 per transaction increase my future cost average as well? Will this reduce my profit margins in the future as my quantity of ETH ownership decreases?

I realize the quantity of ETH that I own will get smaller but as long as the market value continues to increase, I should hypothetically be able to keep DCA'ing out profit, if needed?

At the end of the day, i'm a firm believer in ETH and am extremely bullish. My goal is to maintain my principal deposit amount but only pull profits.
Please let me know if i'm headed in the wrong direction here or may be looking at this process the wrong way.

Reddit,ethereum,Will Bitcoiners Ever Consider a Bitcoin Exchange? 🤔,2024-08-24 11:08:28,"Hey folks, I've been thinking about this lately, I think it's pretty evident by now that hardcore Bitcoiners are all about HODLing their BTC. Not many are a fan of selling off their precious sats. But I am curious as to whether Bitcoiners would ever consider a decentralised exchange for Bitcoin. 

Something akin to a Uniswap-like platform where you could swap your Bitcoin and other assets and then back again seamlessly. Is this appealing? 

And if such an exchange existed, what would one want it to have? I am on about features, it could be anything from lower fees, security or a simple UI. Or is the idea of swapping BTC for anything else a no-go?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,ethereum,"Help Needed: Ethereum HSM Integration Resulting in ""Invalid Sender"" Error",2024-08-20 00:33:43,"**TL;DR:** Integrating HSM to sign Ethereum transactions but getting ""Invalid Sender"" errors despite correct address recovery and signature application. Need help troubleshooting the issue.  
I am trying to implement wallet generation and signing using an HSM.  I'm currently developing against SoftHSM2, with C#.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm running into troubles with ""Invalid Sender""

Hey Ethereum Devs,

I'm currently working on integrating a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to sign Ethereum transactions, and I've run into a persistent ""Invalid Sender"" error that I can't seem to resolve. I’m hoping the community might have some insights or suggestions.

# Background:

I'm using an HSM to securely generate and store Ethereum keys, and then to sign transactions. The process involves retrieving the public and private keys from the HSM, creating a transaction, signing it, and then sending it to the Ethereum network.

Here’s a summary of the workflow:

1. **Retrieve Public Key Info:** I retrieve the public key and its associated label from the HSM based on the Ethereum address.
2. **Generate Transaction Hash:** I use the `Sha3Keccack` hash function to create a message hash from the public key.
3. **Initial Signature:** I generate an initial signature with the retrieved private key using the message hash.
4. **Create Transaction:** I build a `LegacyTransaction` object with the transaction parameters like nonce, gas price, gas limit, etc.
5. **Recompute Transaction Hash:** The transaction hash is recomputed, including the Chain ID to ensure EIP-155 compliance.
6. **Final Signature:** I generate the final signature with the recomputed transaction hash.
7. **Adjust V for EIP-155:** The `V` value is adjusted as per EIP-155 (i.e., `V = finalSignature.V + Chain ID * 2 + 35`).
8. **Apply Final Signature:** I set the final signature on the transaction and serialize it.
9. **Send Transaction:** The serialized transaction is sent to the Ethereum network.

# The Problem:

Despite the transaction being created and signed correctly (as far as I can tell), when I submit it, I consistently get an ""Invalid Sender"" error.

# Debugging Data:

Here’s some of the debug output:

* **Public Key Info:** `Address=0xd2de6f19109d613f17496837e03909ad26632081`, `Label=test`
* **Message Hash:** `dd5e1cc957e9cf152b8e6d7ef12160622a31b329cad932d57998e9334ef0495a`
* **Initial Signature:** `R=0EE8B7B9FE8DAC6267ABADAA5F339D234A4B3CB4BAE4FC3BC31B619A8C726946F`, `S=641FEBC235A4EECA13597671AC5B1A32314D4DD07ABD84F074A93AAC674F77C2`, `V=28`
* **Recovered Address v27:** `0x0D9D930AC4Af2EdB21369c0A362F8c813264B85b`
* **Recovered Address v28:** `0xD2DE6F19109D613f17496837e03909aD26632081` (This is the correct one)
* **Transaction Hash:** `2f0028f56b6e1550d7a34e5da3048ef4ecda121004c38135f276ff7293a6e0db`
* **Final Signature:** `R=76AB822FD1B3D61C0C261B5FEEE33014F95EB658B93412FB8E2C8222C79CB91F`, `S=0811F55B97C7D97253CFD39B76B3A244C612BBEBB13BA76BD2160AFE6C6853FF9`, `V=141`

Despite the correct address being recovered with `V=28`, the transaction still results in an ""Invalid Sender"" error when the signed transaction is submitted.

# Code Snippet:

Here’s the critical part of the code where I believe the issue might be:

    csharpCopy codevar vValue = (byte)(finalSignature.V + _chainId * 2 + 35);
    transaction.SetSignature(new Signature
    {
        R = finalSignature.R,
        S = finalSignature.S,
        V = new byte[] { vValue }
    });
    var serializedTx = transaction.GetRLPEncoded().ToHex();

# What I’ve Tried:

* **Checked V Calculation:** Confirmed that the `V` value is calculated as per EIP-155.
* **Address Recovery:** Verified that the correct address is recovered with `V=28`.
* **Serialized Transaction:** Compared the serialized transaction output with a known good transaction; it looks correct.

# Community Help:

I'm stumped at this point. Does anyone have experience with HSMs and Ethereum transactions? Could it be an issue with the way I’m applying the signature or something subtle in the transaction serialization?

Any advice, suggestions, or pointers would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help! 🙏

Reddit,ethereum,The blobs progress over the past half-year,2024-08-16 20:24:18,"**Can you believe it’s already been 6 months since the Dencun upgrade and the launch of blobs?**

The Dencun upgrade brought us the much-anticipated blobs via EIP-4844, which have improved the Layer 2 users’ experience by making transactions cheaper and more efficient.

 Let’s take a moment to review the progress blobs have made over the past half-year:

* 2.3 million total blobs since the Dencun upgrade 
* 596,000 blocks containing blobs 
* 1.1 million blob transactions 

These numbers only scratch the surface of the significant impact blobs have had on the Ethereum ecosystem, enhancing both efficiency and usability.

The momentum around blobs is growing, with more and more submitters joining in. We now have a robust ecosystem that includes Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Taiko, Scroll, Blast, Linea, Starknet, Zora, Zircuit, Kroma, and many more.

This growing network of L2s is making Ethereum more efficient, affordable, and driving innovation across all layers and dApps.

EIP-4844 also introduced a smart mechanism that adjusts the blob base fee according to supply and demand. Recently, we’ve seen the reaching the current target - 3 blobs per block. This dynamic fee model is designed to keep blob processing efficient and optimize block space.

🔗 Check out more details here: [dune.com/hildobby/blobs](http://dune.com/hildobby/blobs)

Before EIP-4844, there was a lot of uncertainty around pricing. But now, it’s clear that blobs have surpassed expectations. Comparing the cost of blobs to calldata on Rob's dashboard shows just how much cheaper blobs are.

I had polygon USDT sitting in my wallet and I thought I should stake it. So I staked it as sideshift tokens (svXAI/XAI) on the ETH network, and it automatically subtracted the gas fees from the amount that I deposited. However now I need to unstake them, and it seems like I need some ETH for the gas fees. 

I don't even know how much gas it would need, but I think it would be around $2-$3. I don't have any leftover crypto I could swap for ETH except like 20 cents of polygon that I used to pay gas on the polygon network.

I really cannot buy ETH to pay these small fees. I talked with sideshift support and they said they cannot subtract the amount from my tokens. Do I have any options?

Reddit,ethereum,Which Stablecoin is the Safest Against Censorship and Fund Freezing?,2024-08-15 13:18:57,"Hey everyone 

I'm currently trying to decide which stablecoin to use, but I'm concerned about censorship and the possibility of my funds being frozen. I know that both USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin) have had issues in this regard:

USDT: Tether has been known to freeze addresses when asked to by law enforcement or other authorities. This has happened multiple times in the past, which raises concerns about how safe it is to hold USDT if you're worried about potential censorship.

USDC: USD Coin is designed to be fully compliant with U.S. regulations, which means it also has the ability to freeze funds and block transactions if required by the government. Given that it's backed by regulated financial institutions, it seems more prone to responding to regulatory pressures.

Considering these factors, which stablecoin would you say is the safest option if I'm trying to minimize the risk of censorship or having my funds frozen? Are there other stablecoins that might be better in this regard?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,bitcoin,Being realistic doesn’t make you stupid. Why not every investor out there is betting on bitcoin,2024-09-09 15:03:23,"It's fascinating how many Bitcoin enthusiasts in this Reddit-group love to claim that professional investors not investing in BTC is ""stupid"" or just doesn’t understand it. What’s even more amusing is their unshakable belief that they know what will happen to Bitcoin in the future. Let me break it to you: predicting the future of any asset, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin, is like trying to predict the weather a year in advance—it’s guesswork at best.

Let’s be clear: the fact that most professional investors—many of whom have a high risk tolerance—don’t pile into Bitcoin doesn’t mean they’re clueless. Most professional investors are people who analyze markets for a living, not Reddit warriors claiming to have crystal balls. If anything, their hesitance shows they understand that Bitcoin, while revolutionary, is also a high-risk asset with an uncertain future. Its regulatory status is still evolving, the market is subject to wild fluctuations, and the technology is still in its infancy compared to traditional assets.

Not all hesitation stems from ignorance. Some of it comes from experience, from knowing that no one can guarantee the future. So before calling people dumb, maybe take a moment to recognize that being skeptical of a highly speculative asset doesn't mean they ""don't get it""—it means they might just be a bit more realistic than the rest of us.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,bitcoin,One of the most underrated Bitcoin posts on X,2024-09-09 01:54:32,"**Original Source** [https://x.com/danieleripoll/status/1728861014127763538](https://x.com/danieleripoll/status/1728861014127763538) 

The cult-classic movie The Matrix metaphorically describes the fiat monetary system in a scary accurate way. In the movie, AI robots create a mirage for the entire human species in order to absorb all of their life energy. In this world, humans lived a lie while their life energy was drained, unbeknownst to them, for the benefit of the machines. Humans were reduced to batteries.   
  
Is the fiat system not EXACTLY like this?   
  
Replace AI with “bankers” or the “political class” and it’s the same thing. The mirage is that we are sold the American Dream. We take out loans for school, we take on mortgages, we spend on our credit cards in a never ending debt cycle just to try to get ahead. But rather than allow the citizens to benefit from the productivity gains of technology and to save and build wealth over time, they deny us that ability by over taxing us, over regulating us, and debasing the currency.   
  
When J Powell was asked why 2% inflation, the Fed’s target, was even necessary, he couldn’t answer the question. He literally said “I don’t know” in front of a senate committee.   
  
I’ll tell you what J Powell won’t. The inflation is there to make sure you can’t get off the hamster wheel. The more you have to work, the more taxes you’ll generate for Uncle Sam. They want to make sure that they milk you for every ounce of your life’s energy through overt taxes like income,  
sales and property taxes, plus the hidden tax of inflation. Like a battery.   
  
In the movie, Morpheus had always been looking for “the one”. He sought the person who could beat the machines and liberate humanity by unplugging every single human being from the Matrix. I think people are ready. They sense a disturbance in the Matrix. Most cannot articulate the reason for the problems they face, but they know that something is wrong with the money.   
  
In the movie, if humans were made aware of their plight, many would have simply “opted out” of the Matrix by unplugging. If enough people unplugged, the robots would have no energy source. They would cease to exist. Similarly, if humans opted out of the fiat financial system, it too, would cease to exist.   
  
Bitcoin is “the one” technology that can unplug humanity from the fiat money matrix. Maybe economist Friedrich Hayek was actually Morpheus, because he prophesied the invention of Bitcoin long before anyone ever heard of Satoshi.

Reddit,bitcoin,Why Seigniorage and Inflation Could Make Bitcoin the Future of Money,2024-09-09 08:24:05,"
**Seigniorage** is the profit a government makes by issuing currency, calculated as the difference between the cost of producing money and its face value. While this practice has been around for centuries, it comes with serious risks, particularly when it’s abused. Historically, seigniorage has often led to inflation, and in extreme cases, hyperinflation. In today’s global economy, with expanding money supplies and growing debts, these risks are ever-present. However, **Bitcoin** offers a promising alternative, one that is immune to inflationary pressures due to its decentralized and fixed-supply nature.

### Seigniorage Throughout History

The concept of seigniorage is not new. In fact, it dates back to ancient civilizations. The **Roman Empire** is one of the earliest examples where physical seigniorage was widely practiced. Roman emperors would gradually debase their coinage by reducing the amount of precious metal (like silver) in the coins, while maintaining their nominal value. This allowed the empire to mint more coins at a lower cost, thereby increasing the money supply. However, the consequence was significant inflation. Over time, the value of the coins dropped as people recognized they contained less silver. This contributed to the weakening of the Roman economy and its eventual decline.

In more modern history, **Weimar Germany** provides a stark example of inflationary seigniorage gone wrong. After World War I, the German government printed vast amounts of money to pay off war reparations, which led to hyperinflation. By 1923, the currency had become so worthless that people needed wheelbarrows of banknotes just to buy a loaf of bread. Similarly, **Zimbabwe** in the 2000s experienced one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in history. To deal with its economic problems, the government printed enormous amounts of money, leading to inflation rates so extreme that prices would double in mere hours. By 2008, Zimbabwe’s inflation reached an incomprehensible **89.7 sextillion percent per month**.

### Modern Inflationary Risks

In modern economies, the risks of inflationary seigniorage persist. Governments often rely on expanding the money supply to finance debt, especially during crises. Following the **2008 financial crisis** and the **COVID-19 pandemic**, central banks like the **U.S. Federal Reserve** took aggressive measures, including **quantitative easing (QE)**. This involved purchasing government bonds and injecting liquidity into the economy. The **M1 money supply** (which includes cash and checking deposits) expanded from around **$4 trillion in 2019** to over **$20 trillion by 2023**.

While these policies helped stabilize economies in the short term, they also raised concerns about long-term inflation. An ever-growing money supply reduces the value of each dollar, euro, or yen in circulation, threatening to erode purchasing power over time. Although hyperinflation is unlikely in developed economies like the U.S., the potential for rising inflation remains a concern as national debts continue to climb.

### Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation

Bitcoin offers a fundamentally different model. Created in 2009 as a response to the global financial crisis, **Bitcoin** operates on a decentralized network, and its supply is capped at **21 million coins**. This fixed supply makes Bitcoin immune to the inflationary pressures that often accompany fiat currencies. Governments can’t print more Bitcoin to cover their debts, making it a unique **store of value** in uncertain times.

In countries facing hyperinflation, such as **Venezuela**, many citizens turned to Bitcoin to protect their savings as their local currencies collapsed. Bitcoin’s decentralization means no single entity, like a government or central bank, can control its issuance or manipulate its value. While Bitcoin is volatile, its long-term value as a hedge against inflation continues to attract attention from investors and institutions alike.

### A Look to the Future

As Bitcoin approaches its 15th anniversary, it has evolved from a niche asset to a mainstream consideration for many investors. While early adopters saw Bitcoin as a digital currency, it has increasingly been embraced as **""digital gold""**—a secure, inflation-resistant store of value. Over the years, Bitcoin has weathered numerous market fluctuations, but its **decentralized, fixed-supply nature** continues to appeal to those looking for an alternative to fiat currencies that are susceptible to inflationary pressures.

Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s role in the global economy could expand. As governments around the world continue to grapple with rising debts and expanding money supplies, Bitcoin offers a possible path to a more stable and decentralized financial system. Its fixed supply and resistance to inflationary manipulation offer hope for a future where individuals can protect their wealth from the erosion caused by inflationary seigniorage.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

I thought it was wild how it is a real world example of Gresham's Law in action. I wasn't aware of it through my first read. Learning of this was a validation to me that I am confident about how Gresham's Law plays out in our world. ""Bad money drives out good"" as the Law goes. Bitcoin will naturally emerge as the best form of money because the bad fiat money will eventually prove itself to be inferior money.

In the Video Game Money section, the official in-game currency ""gold"" proved itself to be inferior to a magic item deemed universally valuable by the community, the SoJ (Stone of Jordan). Later on, SoJs would be valued in a less scarce commodity called ""Perfect Skulls"".  In this example, gold = $, and SoJs = BTC.

This example just hit right for me because it combines my love for video games, bitcoin, and economic theory all into one.

However, the concepts used for encryption, security, and networking seem to match...            

Connections / Metcalfe's law - In the beginning of my studies, there are some simple things to go over like routers on a mesh network that connect to each other, how many of the routers can communicate with each other etc. if you have 2 routers, that's one connection. If you have 3 routers, 3 connections, 4 routers means 6 connections / paths. And so on...             

Then we get into security fundamentals, hashes are mentioned, private keys and public keys. Integrity of data, (Analogy: like only good blocks being accepted by mining ASICs and nodes.).

In recent months, I’ve been learning about crypto with the aim of making a long-term investment and have been following this Reddit channel and other sources. Right now, it feels like I’m bringing a spoon to a sword fight with all you here but I know there s so many great people too that can reply to this in helpfull ways.

I’m looking to invest around €1000 for now, which seems like a reasonable and safe starting point for me. (I like to se you 50k investments etc but 1k n my legs are shaking for how much feels thinking how I was years ago)

Since I don’t personally know anyone involved in crypto and can’t consult with them directly, I would be grateful if you could share any articles or reliable sources on the best exchanges platforms, news, fees, and other important aspects so I can get better and learning more.
General info sources would also be greatly appreciated!

Any other recommendations are of course welcome.

Reddit,bitcoin,Creating a Bitcoin Reserve from rental property,2024-09-08 02:42:01,"Let's say that you own some rental property that you are able to keep 100% of the rental income in a HYSA and make the payments for mortgage, insurance, and taxes without touching that rental income. I want to start taking that income and build a bitcoin reserve with.

One of the problems I run into is when I need liquidity for repairs or large expenses, that is the time I use that money sitting in the HYSA. However, I don't need 100% of that sitting in the HYSA.

Doing the math it seems that exchanging every months income directly into bitcoin and holding it would be the better option, but having to pay taxes and fees for getting liquidity for expenses would not be ideal.

So I'm thinking that exchanging a large portion of the current balance into bitcoin, like 60-75%, into bitcoin now. And then 50% of future payments into bitcoin and the other 50% to sit in the HYSA. Maybe scaling this up with more into bitcoin as the liquidity equals a comfortable amount.

Has anyone done something similar? If so, what have you found to work best for ultimately stacking as many sats as possible but having liquidity to handle emergencies or unexpected large expenses?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Win $500 in Bitcoin for sharing product feedback: Zengo Wallet AMA,2024-09-08 12:14:03,"We built Zengo in 2018 to fix the biggest problem with self-custody: Seed phrases. Zengo is not a hot or cold wallet. Zengo is a multi-factor MPC wallet: No seed phrase, no single point of failure.

Since 2018: Over 1,000,000 users and a milestone no hardware wallet can claim: 

* 0 wallets taken over
* 0 wallets drained
* 0 wallets phished

Seed phrase maxis may not be interested in Zengo. That's fine - every system has pros and cons. But Zengo's approach solves a problem for many who don't want to leave assets on an exchange, but are worried about seed phrases.

**So no seed phrase: How does Zengo work?**

1. Using a 2-of-2 Multi-Party Computation (MPC) framework, each of the two Zengo parties (Zengo app on user device and Zengo server)[ independently generate](https://zengo.com/how-keys-are-made/) their own “Secret Share” during the wallet creation process. The secret shares are cryptographically locked to prevent MITM attacks.
2. The share randomly generated on the user’s device is called the Personal Share and leverages the device’s hardware-based random number generator (TRNG). Only the Personal share can initialize and sign transactions, all of which are verified by the device’s hardware (Secure Enclave or TEE/Trusted Execution Environment).
3. The share randomly generated on Zengo’s remote server is called the Remote Share and is used to co-sign transactions emerging from the Personal Share.

Using MPC, these two Secret Shares are able to compute their corresponding public key securely. NOTE: We hold the world’s largest open-source cryptographic [MPC library](https://zengo.com/research/) on our GitHub, and all of our cryptography is open-source.

[Single-factor \(seed phrase\) v. Multi-factor \(MPC like Zengo\)](https://preview.redd.it/3e9h3x5vmjnd1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=d751e6069196b8ab35f768607ef445e818e068bc)

  
Even if a hacker gains access to one of the two secret shares, it is still useless to them as they cannot spend user funds.

Lose your phone? The wallet recovery process is simple and secure. More info [here](http://www.zengo.com/security). Worried Zengo closes? [Guaranteed Access](https://zengo.com/how-zengo-guarantees-access-to-customers-funds/) ensures you can always access your funds.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Polkadot: A Decentralized Circus without a Ringmaster,2024-09-09 13:44:54,"*Zurich is a city of precision. It’s a place where every watch ticks with purpose, and every bank vault hides secrets worth more than a small country. But on a brisk morning, as I dragged my luggage through the bustling airport, something caught my eye—an enormous billboard, glowing pink, shouting “Polkadot” in bold letters. At first, I thought it was an advertisement for a new game, or perhaps some quirky Swiss banking service. What I didn’t expect was to stumble upon what might be the most confusing and hollow embodiment of decentralization in the blockchain world.*

You see, I’ve been on a journey. A quest to understand this nebulous concept of decentralization, a term that’s thrown around like confetti at a political rally. Everyone talks about it, few understand it, and even fewer can make it work. When it comes to blockchain, decentralization is supposed to eliminate single points of failure, democratize power, and provide security through consensus. But Polkadot, as I would discover, takes this concept, puts it in a blender, and serves it up as a watered-down cocktail that leaves you wondering if the bartender spiked it with anything at all.

When I landed in Zurich, I thought I’d find something serious behind this flashy marketing. Switzerland, after all, is synonymous with quality and reliability. But as I started peeling back the layers of this project, I quickly realized that Polkadot’s association with the Swiss ethos was purely coincidental. If anything, the most Swiss thing about Polkadot was the labyrinthine network of shell companies designed to obscure who’s really pulling the strings.

Through some well-placed connections, I found myself sipping overpriced coffee with a couple of Zurich’s financial elites—people who know their way around money and aren’t easily impressed by the latest tech fads. I asked them what they thought of Polkadot. A prominent lady banker, who had seen her fair share of financial scams, simply laughed. She called it a case of “investor defraud,” wrapped up in a cute pink logo. Apparently, Polkadot started out selling tokens as securities, but when the regulatory heat got too hot, they magically transformed them into “software,” sidestepping scrutiny in a move that’s as clever as it is suspicious.

Her colleague, a private banking expert, wasn’t any kinder. He dismissed Polkadot as another blockchain project that’s still fumbling to find a compelling use case. Sure, they’ve got something called “parachains,” but in the world of high finance, that means little when no one’s actually using them. The only people who seem to care are those still stuck in the cryptosphere, clinging to the hope that Polkadot will one day matter.

As I dug deeper, I discovered a governance model that’s more reminiscent of a reality TV show than a serious decentralized network. Token holders get to vote, but like in any rigged game, the more tokens you have, the louder your voice. It’s not one vote per person, but rather a dystopian democracy where the whales call the shots, leaving the minnows to scream into the void. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the drama doesn’t stop there.

There’s a particularly juicy beef between Polkadot’s tech provider and a wallet company that once played nice but is now leading a rebellion. This soap opera started when the fearless (literally, they were called Fearless Wallet) team decided they were tired of playing second fiddle. They forked off, launched their own product, and left behind a trail of bad blood that’s still staining Polkadot’s reputation. The wallet provider, now a key player in Polkadot’s governance, seems hell-bent on torpedoing every proposal from their former masters, proving that in Web 3.0, nothing is sacred, and betrayal is just another day at the office.

In the end, what I found in Zurich was not a beacon of decentralization, but a confused and fractured ecosystem, struggling to find its place in the world. Polkadot, for all its grand ambitions and slick marketing, remains a project without a clear purpose. It’s a decentralized circus, but one where the clowns are outnumbering the ringmasters, and the audience is starting to lose interest. 

As I left Zurich, the billboard now felt more like a warning than an invitation—a reminder that not every blockchain project is worth the hype, and that sometimes, decentralization is just a fancy word for chaos.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Crypto Friendly Banks (US),2024-09-09 05:45:52,"Are the majority of banks Crypto Friendly to deposit/withdrawal from exchanges such as Kraken? I have Chase purely out of convenience, accessibility and UI/UX, but I'm hesitant to withdraw more than 100k after doing a bit of research.

I've read multiple stories of people having their accounts closed/frozen for XYZ, although the common denominator of many of them were: being outside the US (different laws/regs) or the fault of the person doing something shady. Now I always take reviews with a grain of salt, because the majority who don't have issues are more than likely to say nothing at all.

So... what is your bank & your experience with them? Anyone with Chase, are you able to smoothly on/off ramp? Should I seek a new bank, I'm considering Ally.

I’ve also been paying attention to fees generated and active users over time to try and identify good opportunities. 

Curious to hear what others value or look at when making investing decisions?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I came up with a strategy that will go against this sub rules! ,2024-09-09 15:06:38,"For the first time, there has to be someone bringing this up and that's me!

The strategy that will be a turning point in this sub and will defy logic, the common knowledge and public thoughts and it is:

Buy low, Sell high(I know I'm gonna be showered with downvotes here and I'm okay with that)

Trust me on this one, buy now, hold for a couple months, if you can't help looking at your portfolio, I strongly recommend you go to coma or sleep for months then you will come back and be amazed with profits because you actually bought low unlike what you did before. 

The prices are so se*y now, there is a high chance of having a couple alt seasons soon because:

1. Btc rainbow chart is at the bottom

2. According to Puell multiple, mvrv and nupl the price is at buy zone

3. Btc dominance is at its peak(57)

4. Dollar index will start dumping

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Stop repeating your wrong definition of ""marketcap""",2024-09-07 17:47:54,"This misconception is repeated in the crypto subs almost daily. 

Market cap DOES NOT equal total money invested. 

Marketcap = (# of coins in circulation) x ($ price per coin)

Price is whatever someone is willing to pay. Therefore marketcap is an imaginary number. Its not a real number of how many dollars are invested into a coin. It can be $1 or a quadrillion. Stop using this metric to justify things to yourself about a coin you like or dont like. 

Example:

You have a tree, it can only make 100 apples. Someone buys 1 apple from you for $1 and just like that suddenly the marketcap of all apples your tree made is $100. Did someone give you this $100? No. Marketcap is an imaginary metric, not the number of dollars someone handed you.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Issue with trust wallet, need to understand if it is a scam and how it works",2024-09-08 16:43:18,"Hello.

I need help with a matter of a Trust Wallet situation of a friend, to understand if we are being scammed (probably, but I don't understand how).

Right now, the situation is that a person has sent us some crypto on the bsc chain, some useless second rate coin (ISHND old version). He said we would need to make a bridge to fantom to draw it out.

We made this bridge (we made a nenw fantom wallet and activated some tokens on both networks I think).

We had to deposit some bnb and then we'd get some WBTC on the bsc chain, which again seems like a scam/dust coin. Already the value of this wbtc seemed to be 0..

The person said that we'd need to finish the open transaction and it would turn to btc (or btcb?) on the fantom blochchain.

The issue was there was a big amount of money needed to send to transform these coins.. ever increasing and the leftover btc seemed to stop near 10 cents.. here we said stop, we're not doing anything anymore..

Then this person tried depositing some btc on fantom (and succeeded), but somebody else (we don't know who), sent some ftm ont he ftm wallet and retrieved all this bitcoin.

Then this person started accusing us of scamming him.. lol..

Next, and we are here now, he said to bridge to Solana and then we could withdraw to binance.

He had us activate ETH on Solana, which seems to be SOETH, some dead coin which is worth 350 dollars a piece.

Now this person is having us deposit solana to the sol wallet and I see some ETH (Solana growing), showing the real value of ETH (which should not be the case).

I don't think or now how we could recover our money from this situation, I don't see how to turn that SOETH into something like SOL and send it to binance so we can cash out..

So, if anyone understands what's happening, can you please help me understand?

At no point did we use the Swap function on Trust Wallet or use any Dex, which is again strange.

I said maybe I'm not understanding, but I don't want to lose more money on this.

The latest thing I did was deposit 10 dollars of Solana, which were drained and replaced with 0.05 ETH on solana (said it's worth 130 dollar but it should actually be like 20).

It seems like a huge scam but I don't understand how the scammer is winning, since they said they also lost their btc which they deposited.. The scammer does not have access to our trustwallet.

I have found [this ](https://www.merklescience.com/how-do-hackers-use-crypto-bridges-to-steal)article on bridge scams, it might be the case here. I wil study it.

Thank you if anyone reads and can help out!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,In It For The Tech,2024-09-07 19:50:18,"Once upon a time, there was a boy named Alex who had the financial wisdom of a YouTube comment section. He decided that crypto was his ticket to fame, fortune, and possibly a private island shaped like a doge. Armed with nothing but a smartphone, a vague understanding of blockchain, and an unhealthy amount of optimism, he took all his money—the entire $142.78 of his life savings—and threw it into cryptocurrency.

The first few months were magical. His investments were skyrocketing! Bitcoin was going to the moon! Ethereum was going to Mars! Some weird coin named after a sushi roll was going to Jupiter! Alex was convinced he was a financial genius. He even started wearing sunglasses indoors, the universal sign of someone who understands markets.

Every time the price dipped, Alex bought more. It didn’t matter if it was 3 a.m. and he had to wake up for school in four hours—he was there, buying the dip. He started working odd jobs to feed his addiction. He mowed lawns, washed cars, and even babysat his neighbor’s cat, Mr. Whiskers, who somehow paid better than all his other gigs combined. But it was worth it, because Alex knew he was going to be rich. Filthy rich. Jeff Bezos was going to be calling him for loans.

One day, Alex’s portfolio hit $50,000. Yes, fifty thousand dollars. He couldn't believe it. He looked at his screen like it was the face of a newborn child. He even tried to hug it, only to knock over his glass of orange juice and short-circuit his keyboard. But that didn’t matter. He could buy a thousand keyboards now! Life was good.

Then came The Day. You know, *that* day. The day when every crypto holder collectively whispered, “Oh no.”

At first, Alex thought it was just another dip. No problem, right? He'd just buy more. But this dip didn’t stop. It didn’t even slow down. It was like someone pressed the fast-forward button on the fall from grace. Bitcoin plummeted, Ethereum followed suit, and SushiSwap—well, it flopped like a day-old sushi roll.

Alex stared at his portfolio as his $50,000 evaporated faster than the promises of a Nigerian prince in an email. His life savings were now worth less than the cost of a Starbucks latte. In a last-ditch effort to salvage his pride, Alex sold all his remaining coins and walked away with a grand total of $3.27 and some digital breadcrumbs from Dogecoin.

But instead of freaking out, Alex did something truly remarkable. He stood up, stretched, and with the confidence of someone who had just mastered the art of denial, said, “I’m in it for the tech.”

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Need Advice on DCA Strategy: Down 60% and Not Sure What to Do Next,2024-09-07 19:21:39,"# Hey everyone,

# I've been DCA-ing into crypto since January and could use some guidance. My portfolio is currently around 60% Ethereum, 20% Bitcoin, and 20% in altcoins (like Fantom, Fetch, Arcam, etc.). Unfortunately, I'm down around 60% overall — my altcoin investments alone are now worth around $500 to $700 from a total of $3,000, and my 1.5 ETH, bought at $3,500, hasn't fared much better.

# I'm stuck wondering if I should just cut my losses and sell or hold tight. I know the market can be unpredictable, but I’d appreciate any thoughts on whether it makes sense to keep going with my current strategy or switch things up.

# Has anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do, and how did it turn out for you?

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-12 02:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

I've done two summer camps, both heavily focused on cryptology, and I learned about the basics like RSA and other encryption algorithms. I also learned about Shor's algorithm, and cryptology in the post-quantum world. I was under the impression that if an efficient, large-scale quantum computer was built tomorrow, we wouldn't have an algorithm that couldn't just be cracked by Shor's algorithm, but I did more research and I'm pretty sure that's not true anymore. I wanted to get your guys' opinions, on whether or not we have encryption techniques that could be implemented once a quantum computer is manufactured.

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 13:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,crypto,Symmetric key exchange protocol,2024-09-07 21:55:12,"Hi folks,

I was trying to fill in the gap for use case for SKREM-like ciphers I posted about (which I invented and got peer reviewed in 2021). It's of course a symmetric key cipher. The only major thing lacking is bilateral key exchange over a public channel. Monkey in the middle I can prevent with Lamport-like digital signing.

So I was wondering if we can do any better than Meet in the Middle key exchange.

I think we can.. and I got this idea, based on There Pass Protocol.

1. Alice picks a truly random large master table g of size n bits (say 1 GB long). She also chooses truly randomly a permutation p of n elements, consisting of a single cycle of length n.
2. Alice sends Bob the master g table with the bits permuted by p.
3. Bob receives and further permutes by a permutation q also of n elements consisting of a single cycle of length n.
4. Bob sends to Alice the result.
5. Alice applies p^-1 to the message from Bob and sends to Bob.
6. Bob receives second message from Alice and applies q^-1.

Now both Bob and Alice have the same info on master table g. This is since such permutations comute.

Potentially, it can be combined with Meet in the Middle Key exchange, by encrypting  step 5 with the short key obtained by MIM KE.

Note that permutations are not themselves sent but just their application to the large GMT.

This looks pretty cool and maybe quite secure to me.. am I missing something? Why is this not in literature? Or is it?

Thanks!

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 20:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,crypto,Falcon vs. Dilithium vs. SPHINCS+,2024-08-30 21:39:49,"What do you believe is the best choice.

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 12:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 13:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

Reddit,crypto,"Seeking Feedback and Security Assessment for My New Encryption Method ""FlexCrypt""",2024-08-18 22:44:29,"I’ve developed a new encryption method called **FlexCrypt** and I would greatly appreciate your feedback and security assessment. FlexCrypt combines several techniques, including hex pair reversal, permutation-based encryption, and XOR encryption. Below are the details:

# How Does FlexCrypt Work?

1. **Hex Reversal**: The plaintext is first converted into a hexadecimal format, and then the hex pairs are reversed.
2. **Permutation of Hex Pairs**: Using a permutation key (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]), the hex pairs are randomly rearranged.
3. **XOR Encryption**: Finally, the rearranged hex text is encrypted using a 128-bit XOR key. This key length can be increased to 192 or 256 bits for enhanced security.

# Example:

* **Plaintext**: ""Hello World!""
* **Encrypted Text**: ""f7b72d60""
* **Decrypted Text**: ""Hello World!""

# Key Management

* **XOR Key**: A 128-bit key used for XOR encryption (with the option to increase to 192 or 256 bits).
* **Permutation Key**: A key that determines the order of the hex pairs (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]).

# Questions for the Community:

1. How do you assess the security and efficiency of FlexCrypt compared to established methods like AES?
2. Are there any vulnerabilities or attack vectors that I might have overlooked?
3. Under what conditions could FlexCrypt be practically applied?

# Challenge:

Here are some encrypted texts using FlexCrypt. I’d like to challenge the community to see if you can crack them:

* **Challenge 1:** 9bf4ac1a0917d41df90f (128 bit)
* **Challenge 2:** 0ed819acd9856bbf67b15b12 (192bit)
* **Challenge 3:** 9918da0ef57306502b5b (256bit)

Feel free to share your attempts and findings!

Originally I was told to refer to the Intel Manuals to learn more about cryptographic hardware extensions.

However I admit I have no experience in hardware RTL designs nor assembly. Plus Intel CPUs are proprietary and I can't just make edits to them without risking lawsuits (or worse). So I decided to pay attention to the RISC-V Cryptographic Hardware Extensions--which are open source.

Reddit,crypto,The commitments in Groth16 never get opened!,2024-08-16 15:53:39,"[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) uses something very similar to KZG commitments (the Powers of Tau in a trusted setup & use of Elliptic Curve Pairings), though the paper doesn't mention KZG at all. 

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 05:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-08 03:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-04 02:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);
        record.start_size_header(2);
        record.write(signature);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 21:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

    G = (

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,2024-08-03 20:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code.

Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Even if the code is flawed, as long as your team-mates can refactor the code the code that is legible but flawed will eventually be improved and outshine the original code that is correct **but** illegible.

Reddit,crypto,Most Used Languages to Program Cryptography in Production?,2024-07-25 09:04:31,"Hello Everyone.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

Reddit,crypto,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",2024-07-24 20:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈).",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,crypto,What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,2024-07-21 16:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;
    },

Reddit,crypto,Best Crypto Libraries to Study and Learn From,2024-07-19 17:24:41,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to research coding techniques for constant-time when programming cryptography. Of course a simple solution is study and read **the source code** from pre-existing crypto libraries.

Which crypto libraries would you recommend I study and learn from? The ideal crypto libraries are the ones whose source code is:

1. Easy to Understand
2. Constant-Time
3. Lab Tested to Be Secure Against Common Attacks (E.g. FIPS-validated)

The closest library I could think of so far is BearSSL since Thomas Pornin wrote decent documentation on constant-time cryptography and Multi-Precision Arithmetic.

What other such libraries do you recommend?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,crypto,Question about Groth16 trusted setup & also about the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony,2024-07-19 09:22:14,"This is the CRS generated by Groth16 Trusted Setup.

https://preview.redd.it/6j48x6a1redd1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f10d930771d9ea0147e8ccb5342d551e4942b7

As per the moonmath manual this is a circuit specific Trusted Setup & I agree with the moonmath manual on this. If the number of gates in the circuit changes, then the full CRS changes.

&#x200B;

If you split this into 2 phases

\- Phase 1 - you generate the Powers of Tau for A & B (i.e. Powers of Tau for G1 & G2) & discard Tau as  toxic waste

\- Phase 2 - you generate the remaining things

However, there is a problem here - using just the Tau powers, you can compute every part of the remaining CRS except one part - the last part which I have marked in Red - the h(tau).t(tau) part.

This cannot be generated without knowing the value of t(tau) & the value of t(tau) changes if the number of gates increases or decreases.

&#x200B;

So why split into 2 parts - this is what I think is the purpose of splitting into 2 parts.

It's to enable the perpetual powers of Tau ceremony.

[https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377)

&#x200B;

In the above description of the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony, I see the following

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick any point of the ceremony to begin their circuit-specific second phase.

&#x200B;

What I think this means is

\- Perpetual Rounds means Phase 1 doesn't stop.

\- In Round 1 of Phase 1, they generate a CRS for n gates - they generate a tau, compute the powers of tau & store it. They also compute Tn(tau) & store it along with it.

\- In Round 2 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+1) gates - they generate a new tau from the older tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+1(tau) along with it.

\- In Round 3 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+2) gates - they generate a new tau from the 2nd tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+2(tau) along with it.

&#x200B;

And so on & so forth - anything someone has a circuit with a higher number of gates, another round of Phase 1 is done. 

&#x200B;

Now if a zkSNARK with n gates wants to use the Phase 1 output, they use the Round 1 output, if they have n+1 gates, they use the Phase 1 Round 2 output & so on.

And since the output contains T(tau) also along with the powers of tau, the full second phase can be computed for that tau

Can someone who understands this, let me know if what I describe is correct? If it is not, how what is the procedure used which allows Phase 2 to be done without knowing the value of T(tau)? T(tau) is required for generate the CRS which helps compute the commitment of H.T - this is that part of the CRS -  (tau^i * t(tau))/delta}_{i=0 to n-2}. T depends on number of gates in the circuit - i.e. T(tau) changes if now of gates in the circuit changes.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

I'll tell you what the catch is. **This coin is a catch!**

OG Devs crushed this gem from **400k** -> **20k** Sep 1st.

Team stepped in and stepped up and brought it all the way back to **250k** within hours, and now, more than a week later, we've stabilized at **150k** MC.

ATH? **2.5M.**

Goal? **250M** representing the amount of possible voters in the US.

With election hype heating up, people being disillusioned with politics, and **Elon Musk** referring to D.O.G.E. every chance he's got, this meme-coin is **ripe for the taking.**

Other than that, at **VoteDoge** we just have a whole lot of fun, and some of the **dankest** and **most relatable** memes in the meme-sphere.

With the **debate tomorrow**, this is a really great entry. So many memes are gonna come out of that debate, and when you see **VoteDoge** **going viral** on other subs than just crypto-subs, you’re gonna regret looking at where the chart is now, and then, that is at least if you didn’t buy in.

They say they’re “for the people,” but we all know they fall short. $VOTEDOGE is here to show them how it’s done—by the people, for the people. We represent the real power of the people, and we’re using humor and unity to prove that we can do what they claim, but don’t.



While politicians talk in circles, we take action. One holder at a time, we’re building a movement that’s redefining what it means to have true influence. $VOTEDOGE is more than just a token—it’s a symbol of the people's power, a beacon of change that shows what happens when a community comes together for a common goal.



Our mission is clear: to take $VOTEDOGE all the way to the White House and beyond. We’re not just aiming for the moon, we’re aiming to reshape how people view leadership, one vote at a time. Every new holder strengthens our mission and brings us closer to proving that real power doesn’t belong to politicians—it belongs to us.



Join us as we rise. $VOTEDOGE is here to make history, one vote, one holder, one step at a time. Together, we’ll reach our goal.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,We're still flying under the radar,2024-09-07 20:52:42,"Kendu Inu has been making plays in the shadow recently. I know it's the weekend currently and you probably don't want to read much so I'll make this post short. 

Let me introduce you to the face of Kendu, Miazaki. Miazaki is our developer who is highly regarded by some and critisised by others. Critics do not like that he uses unhinged and vulgar language, as well as keeping secrets. Personally, I think his mannerisms are funny, and while some do not it is not a reason to disown the project. 

A major reason why I trust Kendu and the developer, is because we don't follow a typical memecoin roadmap. We haven't paid any KOL's and all marketing is done organically, as you've probably seen community members shilling on X (twitter), Reddit, TikTok and Stocktwits. Furthermore, we recently announced Kendu debit cards, and have a NFT Marketplace which will launch soon. These recently announced debit cards and NFT marketplace also reinforce the different path we are taking. We aren't waiting for anyone to come and save us. We aren't sitting around waiting for someone like Elon, Vitalik or a big influencer to randomly tweet about us. We ARE actively progressing the project to a point where Kendu when it was first created is COMPLETELY different to what we are now regardless of what the chart says.

For me, this places a lot of trust in our developer and the community (which is the biggest alpha of kendu) and is why I've been holding for months now without selling a single coin.

https://preview.redd.it/hlflrsfy2fnd1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5ab6847169805b7ee915cfd96a27c4dda0dba4

Anyway, you may ask ""how we have flown under the radar?"" If you look on crypto twitter, you'll likely see no one talking about us. All these big twitter influencers all are being paid by developers to shill a coin. The reason they don't shill us is they do not currently hold a bag of Kendu. This means that we have gained our marketcap WITHOUT outside help. When we inevitably start to be recognised by influencers think of the marketcap we can grow to. 

 

Also as an extra part to this post look at this redistribution (shown below, look at the ratio of buys to sells!!!!). When redistribution phases happen, our circulation is increased. Tokens are spread more evenly across a larger number of holders, which in turn reduces the concentration of coins among a few whales. This ultimately helps prevent whales from dumping on us, which strengthens Kendu going forward. Furthermore, we also recieve an increase trading volume and liquidity. When these large sells occur, the whales selling and the masses buying all contribute to the volume which will increase the popularity and attention we recieve. If this isn't convincing, think about whether a project with $1000000 daily volume is more bullish than a project with only $1000 daily volume. Also, when more people have tokens to trade, it can create a more active market. Which is also generally seen as positive because it means there's more interest in the coin.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,$HEGE Already Up 226%—and the VC Money Hasn’t Even Hit Yet!,2024-09-06 22:01:50,"$HEGE just locked in its **first VC investment**, and guess what? While most meme coins are tanking hard—check out $BRETT down -27%, $PONKE down -45%, $WIF down -52%—$HEGE is doing the **opposite**. 🚀

https://preview.redd.it/y4pskv3w98nd1.jpg?width=1118&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15e60821eee6146e1346cfdc45f00202d80eb980



👉 2**26% gains and counting! **👈

🌐 [hegecoin.com](https://www.hegecoin.com/)

Here’s the real kicker though… **we haven’t even seen the VC money come in yet!**

The deal is structured so that the VC will be scooping up $HEGE in daily chunks of **$1k-$5k** until they hit **$150k** minimum. But rumors are swirling that they might be gearing up for even more! If you jump in *now*, you can outpace this big move and position yourself for some serious gains. 

Let me break it down for you:

• **$WIF** went from $14M market cap to **$4B** in 2.5 months after VC backing. 

• **$BRETT** exploded from $5M to **$1.9B** in no time. 

• **$Bonk**? A staggering **5000% increase** in a few days! 

• **$Ponke**? Rumored VC-backed, hit an ATH of **$314M**.

**See the trend?** 👀 When VCs jump in, things e**xplode!** And the best part? $**HEGE’s VC money hasn’t even started flowing yet.** This is your chance to grab the front seat on this rocket ship! 🚀

While the rest of the market bleeds red, $HEGE is primed to break through the stratosphere. The chart doesn’t lie—$HEGE’s got momentum, and it’s **just getting started!**

This is YOUR chance to front-run the VCs and be part of something massive.

**Sound like a golden opportunity?** 🤑 B*ecause it is.*

🔑 Y**our next move: **ULwSJmmpxmnRfpu6BjnK6rprKXqD5jXUmPpS1FxHXFy

**But don’t just take our word for it—Reddit is buzzing with excitement over $HEGE! $HEGE, the authentic MemeCoin born from Reddit, is ready to skyrocket to a billion-dollar market cap on the Solana Network!**

**Don’t wait until you’re watching from the sidelines.** The next leg up is coming. Are you in, or are you just going to watch $HEGE moon without you?

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Moon Confirmed! Reddit-Born $HEGE is Minted After VC Announcement!,2024-09-05 20:53:11,"Reddit-born token $HEGE is about to take off to the stratosphere! $HEGE just secured it's first VC investment, and the community is already hard at work locking down a second B-round VC investment. This is massive!

https://preview.redd.it/818nvbrlo0nd1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cac1d7cdf0e6203d0685bea6473812385bf0af2

**Here’s the kicker: You can still front-run the VC!** 

The investment deal is structured in such a way that the VC will be buying in small chunks of $1k-$5k per day until they reach a minimum of $150k. And guess what? There are strong rumors that they might be planning to buy even more! So if you get in now, you can front-run this big move and position yourself for some serious gains.

Let’s break it down for you:

• **$WIF** went from a $14M market cap to $4B in just 2.5 months after a VC investment. 🚀

• **$BRETT** exploded from a $5M market cap to an astonishing $1.9B. 🌋

• **$Bonk** did a mind-blowing 5000% in just a few days! 💥

• **$Ponke**, which reached an ATH of $314M, is also rumored to be VC-backed.  


**See the pattern here?** 👀 When VCs jump in, things can go ballistic! And the best part? VC money hasn’t entered yet, so you have a chance to get in before them. Does this sound like a golden opportunity to you? I think so! 🤑

**If there was ever a moment to use this contract code to transform your life, that moment is now. Don’t miss out on your chance for life-changing gains:**

**But wait, there’s more!** The $HEGE community is working hard on a massive outreach campaign to get $WIF’s VC to invest in the next round of $HEGE funding. While nothing is confirmed yet, based on the $HEGE team and community’s track record, I’d say this could very well happen, and we could be looking at a VC round worth **millions**! 

And that’s not all! Did I mention that GATE.io, a tier 1 crypto exchange, is eyeing $HEGE? No surprise there! Imagine what could happen if you get in before GATE—think *god candle*!

But the excitement doesn’t stop here! $HEGE has caught the eye of a AI software company that specializes in beating social media algorithms. They’ve had massive success working with TikTok and Instagram influencers, sometimes gaining millions of followers. This could mean **viral growth** for $HEGE! 

Still not enough? $HEGE is in talks for partnerships to use $HEGE at over 1,000 real-world businesses. Nothing confirmed yet, but let’s see what our devs cook up! 🍲 And here’s the kicker: one side of this potential partnership? The saxophonist for Pink Floyd! 🎷🔥

**Think that’s it? Not quite!**

The $HEGE NFT collection is dropping soon! As mentioned a few days ago, $HEGE presale/whitelist date is September 17th, and the full collection launch is on September 19th. Get ready to snag some exclusive NFTs!

**And to top it all off, here’s a bunch of testimonials from the $HEGE community, because why not?**

[To be honest, this is just a small part of testimonials that we have. $HEGE community is rentless about raving about $HEGE.](https://preview.redd.it/l3jd0ki1s0nd1.jpg?width=3914&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=229b83330c66b5b162c8d622c5ead6cd246f0149)

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,5 reasons why everyone should buy $BTW ,2024-09-06 15:03:21,"I would like to present you a project you have probably have not heard about yet. $BTW is a hidden gem that can get us all out of the trenches and if you are reading this post, $BTW might be your life opportunity because all the marketing is just around the corner.

**But first, what exactly is $BTW?** $BTW is a community run token based on the famous artwork of a banana taped to a wall. Creating a whole new category of coins.

**So where is $BTW and what are the next steps?**

* **Insane upside potential -** $BTW is only at 1,3M market cap after reaching 20M ATH just 1 month ago. This means 100x growth is still possible and just $100 investment can turn into $10,000. After all, we have seen several times Reddit coins pump to 100M or higher.
* **Community -** $BTW have INSANELY big community. There is over 9,000 Telegram members and over 5,400 X followers.
* **Content -** $BTW chose a completely new path of organic marketing. Instead of art and animations, they are doing crazy stuff in banana costumes and are taping bananas to basically anything. Taking photos and videos of all this and posting them on social media.
* **Numbers -** Because they chose something new, it quickly became viral and started getting millions of views on social media. Their crazy stunts are even being reposted by meme pages and streamers/youtubers.
* **New website -** It usually is not something really that bullish but I fw that idea. They are working on a new website that will include a map of every banana our community taped somewhere. Soon the whole world will be full of bananas taped to something and everything will be accessible on this website

Overall, this project definitely deserves more noise because all the work they are putting into this. It is extremely rare to see people doing something similar just to pump a project. I personally will be adding more at these levels because the opportunity waiting there for us is something you do not see often.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,The Top 5 Reasons for Investing in Kendu Inu,2024-09-04 20:24:33,"Recently I've noticed a lot of posts about $KENDU which all cover the various aspects of Kendu, which can seem kind of overwhelming to the average investor. So I've compiled my personal top 5 reasons for investing in Kendu:

**5. 'Utility':** We have actually created a NFT Marketplace, and before you toss this away because of the poor reputation, hear me out. We have actually created a way to pay dividends to holders if you are interested i've made a post (admittedly now deleted) here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NFTsMarketplace/comments/1f80zyb/comment/llbekcn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFTsMarketplace/comments/1f80zyb/comment/llbekcn/) or you could look at this chart (see below) which does a really good job of explaining it.

https://preview.redd.it/j66180b9jtmd1.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=13b6f56a3342e661ccd79964a3c99161b1cf450c

**4. Strong support compared to other communities:** If you've been in the memecoin scene the past month you have probably heard of Neiro which has recently gone from 300 million marketcap to 30 million, and in their community telegram you can see everyone spreading FUD, people purely panicking and general chaos. But over at the Kendu telegram we've undergone similar tribulations and the entire time the community as a whole puts their heads down and works, ignoring the chart completely. This might not seem important/big to many of you, but this is a main reason I personally have such a high conviction in this project.

**3. There is always something new on the horizon**. When I first joined Kendu 4 months ago, there was rumours/hype building up around the Shiba Inu magazine. This eventually came true just as everyone expected it to. This also happened with Kendu Chad's (our NFT Marketplace) where it was being rumoured and eventually came true. And just recently, we've heard talk of an announcment between Kendu and Zebec (who we have a debit card partnership with) that should be coming soon. I don't expect this announcment to be anything insane, but it is always nice to have something on the horizon.

**2. The recent redistribution phase we've experienced (suffered):** Simply, when price goes down and holder count goes up, it's basic redistribution, which is where a whale sells and the masses buy the sold tokens. The definition on the Kendu telegram follows as: Jeety John sells $KENDU for $1000. Sexy Sally, Magnificent Michael, and Chad Charlie buy $700 worth of $KENDU between them. A lot of you may ask why this is bullish. Clearly the price hasn't moved even when redistribution happened but OP is saying it's bullish?

To put it broadly, redistribution here can be apart of a long term strategy to stabilise and grow the value of a memecoin, making it bullish for the project’s future, even if the immediate price impact is minimal, and how is this achieved?

To start with, when redistribution phases happen, our circulation is increased. Tokens are spread more evenly across a larger number of holders, which in turn reduces the concentration of coins among a few whales. This ultimately helps prevent whales from dumping on us, which strengthens Kendu going forward.

Furthermore, we also recieve an increase trading volume and liquidity. When these large sells occur, the whales selling and the masses buying all contribute to the volume which will increase the popularity and attention we recieve. If this isn't convincing, think about whether a project with $1000000 daily volume is more bullish than a project with only $1000 daily volume. Also, when more people have tokens to trade, it can create a more active market. Which is also generally seen as positive because it means there's more interest in the coin.

**1. We go against the current memecoin meta**. As you've probably seen recently with coins like neiro, most memecoins generally follow a similar path, this being when a developer will launch 50 different coins all with a 'funny' meme which is mostly narrative driven (neiro being the Doge killer). The dev would hope that one of these goes to 1 mil, and turn his attention to it by paying KOLs and trying to pump it short term.

At Kendu, we are completely organic (which is a saturated term I know but hear me out), back a couple months ago when we were at a 3 million marketcap, our developer, Miazaki said he had alpha that if he released would instantly pump kendu to 50 mil. Turns out, he wasn't lying, but he released this alpha slowly, so overtime we rose to 50 mil.

Furthermore, here at Kendu we are different from that path as you can see. We haven't paid any KOL's and all marketing is done organically, as you've probably seen community members shilling on X (twitter), Reddit, TikTok and Stocktwits. Furthermore, these recently announced debit cards and NFT marketplace also reinforce the different path we are taking. We aren't waiting for anyone to come and save us. We aren't sitting around waiting for someone like Elon, Vitalik or a big influencer to randomly tweet about us. We ARE actively progressing the project to a point where Kendu when it was first created is COMPLETELY different to what we are now regardless of what the chart says.

For me, this places a lot of trust in our developer and the community (which is the biggest alpha of kendu) and is why I've been holding for months now without selling a single coin.



Anyway, this is my personal list of the top 5 reasons someone should invest in Kendu Inu so remember this isn't financial advice and you should always do your own research.

But wait, there’s more! **Rumors are swirling about a HUGE announcement dropping today**. Could this big buy be a hint of what’s to come? The timing seems almost too perfect, doesn’t it? With the market buzzing and confidence in $HEGE growing stronger every day, it feels like we’re on the cusp of something massive—**billion-dollar massive**.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Why I remain bullish on Monkeyhaircut ($MONK),2024-09-05 21:32:26,"I think it's only a moment of time until $MONK sees some strong reversals. 

The vast majority of the memecoin market is down, with $MONK being one of the big names that saw a heavy sell-off over the last few months. Having hit $30 million market cap in May, you can now pick up $MONK at a market cap of $1.7 million.

$MONK has ALWAYS been volatile. One of the most volatile of the big names that was launched all the way back in December 2023, around the same time as $WIF. When you actually consider the 'chart' on a long-term basis, it is actually potentially forming a very bullish pattern given its pattern during the early months following launch. I've been following $MONK since the end of last year, and I notice the declines on the valuation of the coin are very slow and sluggish, while the spikes are pretty damn violent. When this thing rips, it rips.

Twitter member metaversejoji even tweeted to his 200k followers in late July that he is early awaiting a strong recovery in $MONK, having held it the most only second to $WIF, which went onto reach a market cap peak of $4.85 billion.

https://preview.redd.it/v1lbhv33x0nd1.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a400d3b10533875f596b78dea20f64d88fc5438

If you're thinking purchase liquidity is low in the memecoin space, $NEIRO is literally up by +125% in the last 24 hours, sitting at $6.3 million. We never know exactly when certain coins will spike.  
  
Even after falling over 90% from May levels, it is still holding at $1,700,000. I wrote it out in full, because that's a lot of money, and it shouldn't be sniffed at as a potential floor going into Q4 2024 and2025, which will see a lot of new chapters in the crypto space in my opinion.

In fact, $MONK has been heavily attractive for memecoin whales, and is clearly one many traders are familiar with. The market knows $MONK is not a scam and can facilitate majors trading volumes during bullish seasons, compared to other newly launched coins that quickly collapse. Some of the single trades have amounted to over $70,000, with a bunch of the orders over 2024 below in the green column.

The admins have not stopped promoting $MONK since the launch. Literally every single day there is new content being launched across social media. You can track the telegram to see on t.me/monkeyhaircut. The single tweet below amassed over 450,000 views. No one on the team appears to be stopping and that's one of the most bullish signs for me.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,8-Bit Coin changing the whole Solana GameFi space ,2024-09-04 16:30:34,"“We have created $COIN in 2024 with one simple goal, to render it as the most valuable gaming-focused asset”. -Team

8-Bit Coin will probably never stop surprising me. When you look at the chart and market cap you would think that the team spend enormous amounts of money on marketing, calls, partnerships etc. But the opposite is the truth. To date, there has been almost 0 marketing. Only some Reddit posts and 1 single small partnership.

So no, I am not joking when I say 8-Bit Coin will be the biggest GameFi project on Solana.

And the reason? Well, it is very simple. The people on the team are BONK whales. And when I say whales I mean one of the biggest holders of BONK. And they made this coin with 1 goal. To level up game development on Solana network.

Just imagine what will happen once the real bull-run starts and they start with paid marketing. BONK partnership, big institutions, articles everywhere.

8-Bit Coin is a great investment right now because as one of the community members said “Literally the easiest buy and hold, number goes up like the s&p.” So you can make nice 2x at this stage with no marketing and shitty market. BUT!!!!! Once they start, holy macaroni this will be insane.

8-Bit Coin is one of those projects that everyone should have in their portfolio if they want some nice safe returns.

Based on current levels, $WIF would require $1.5 billion inflow to create a 100% return on investment. This is relative to $MONK's inflow requirement of $1.9 million.

I'm blown away with what kendu has to offer, the community is really next level and is pretty much all you need to make it to the moon. I've seen various communities and I can tell you that kendu is special, if you take a look at it and stick around long enough. You will get it. This is it guys, don't miss your chance to moon.

There is no need to park your money anywhere else in crypto as this is as safe as it gets.

Bitget's CEO talked to us over twitter space 

Big give aways done regularly, recently kendu dev gave away 450m (500m total counting the past ones) kendu split into 50m split for a competition for shilling in videos in real life over twitter. The next one's going to be a billion tokens. and more on the way most likely.

Community engagement is top notch, holders are coming in organically and it's growing overtime. It is just too big to fail at this point with it's fundamentals.

NFT's as a side part, when bitcoin died a year later after it boomed everyone thought it was over, the same thing goes for the NFT's i'm sure it'll have it's boom back with the nft mania when it comes again with kendu too. kendu community minted 2m worth of it.

This is the time for everyone who wants to front-run big KOLs and people that will buy after collabs. The market cap is around 21M which might seen high but in reality there is still 40x potential thanks to the connections with BONK. Basically anything under 50M is insanely early.

Always DYOR but I started buying this coin at 5M market cap and I have kept buying small amount since then. The first post about this coin I made was when it reached 11M so if you saw it and listened to my advice you could have gotten the easiest stress-free 2x ever.

💪 Proven Resilience: While other coins crumble under pressure, $HEGE bounces back stronger every time. This isn’t just luck—this is pure, unstoppable momentum.

🌍 Major Exchange Visibility: With listings on #MEXC and #BitMart, $HEGE is already positioned for explosive growth. The buyback plan is set to boost liquidity even further, making this the perfect storm for gains.

🎯 Perfect Entry Point: Remember last time? We went from $10 million to $31 million in less than 5 days. The momentum is stronger than ever, with big whales already making moves and the community buzzing about hitting $80 million soon.

“We have created $COIN in 2024 with one simple goal, to render it as the most valuable gaming-focused project”. -Team

I really like GameFi and when I find a really good project like $COIN I just can not help myself and have to find everything about the token.

This coin project was created to level up game development on the Solana network. The goal is to on-board the next wave of web2 gamers into web3

What is interesting about this coin is its connection with Bonk. $COIN has 3 liquidity pools. SOL, USDC and Bonk. The reason for this is very simple. If you dig into all the wallets you will find out that some of the team members are huge Bonk whales with millions in $BONK.

The Dexscreener page might seem weird but this is only because $COIN is still in early stage when team members are setting everything up and preparing their project for this bullrun.

And even though they have not started with marketing yet you can see that the chart looks insane and this project will go to places.

If you want to find out more about this gem, join our Telegram and we will answer any questions you have.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Kendu Inu is the best project in DeFi right now.,2024-08-28 17:07:43,"After taking a closer look at a cryptocurrency that’s been making waves, Kendu Inu, it's clear where this project is headed. Now, this isn’t just another digital asset vying for attention; it’s a rapidly growing movement, and it’s on the cusp of something big with the upcoming launch of the Kenduchads NFT marketplace. So, let’s unpack what this means and why it might just be worth your attention.

First, let’s talk about the marketplace itself. It’s set to go live once the ‘Chads’ NFT collection is fully minted. And here’s where it gets interesting—this collection is already halfway there, marking one of the most significant NFT minting events in the past two years. Yes, you heard that right—two years. For those who want to get involved, you can still mint a Chad for 5 million $KENDU, which translates to around $384 USD. But owning a Chad isn’t just about having another digital asset; it’s about becoming part of a larger community. What’s more, owning a Chad entitles you to 2.5% of all marketplace fees, paid out in Ethereum. And according to the latest updates, that percentage might even increase to 5%. That’s substantial.

Now, in terms of accessibility, Kendu Inu is about to become even more user-friendly. The project’s lead developer, Kendu Miazaki, recently announced that soon you’ll be able to buy Kendu directly with mainstream payment methods—Visa, Mastercard, and even Apple Pay. This is a significant step forward, making it easier than ever for people to get involved. Additionally, the introduction of Kendu cards, which will allow users to deposit up to $1000 and spend it virtually anywhere without KYC requirements, represents a bold move towards financial inclusivity.

But perhaps the most compelling point to consider is the current market situation. Right now, Kendu Inu is experiencing a dip—a natural occurrence in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. However, this dip presents a unique opportunity. Experts are projecting that Kendu Inu could reach a $100 billion market cap in the next bull cycle. That’s billion with a “B.” For those willing to take the plunge now, the potential returns could be extraordinary.

The Kendu Ecosystem is thriving, and the community behind it is stronger than ever. We’re not just talking about aiming for the moon here—this project is building something far more ambitious, with plans to explore new frontiers. And those Kendu cards? They’re more than just a convenient payment method; they’re a symbol of the future Kendu Inu is striving to create.

So, as we look ahead, the question isn’t just whether Kendu Inu will succeed—it’s how far it can go. This is a story that’s still being written, and it’s one you might want to be part of. As you look around this space, everyone is talking about Kendu Inu, comparing themselves to Kendu Inu, borrowing pieces of the white paper for their own projects. None of them show any potential to outperform the original. Kendu Inu is the right project with the right team, and you can join anytime you like.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Kendu Inu now has an officially verified account on StockTwits,2024-08-28 20:30:47,"More big news for the Kendu Inu ecosystem as we recently obtained a verified account on StockTwits, only the second memecoin to accomplish this.  I might add that the other memecoin to do this is sitting at a marketcap of 1.5billion whereas Kendu is only hovering around 70million right now.  I advise you to not ignore the obvious signs when it comes to Kendu's potential.  Not only did we get a verified account, but the Co-Founder and CEO of Stocktwits Howard Lindzon (who has over 200k followers on StockTwits) shared a post specifically mentioning Kendu.  

For those who are unfamiliar with StockTwits, it's essentially a social media platform focused on stock and crypto trading with live price updates and tends to lean towards serious traders.  This just shows that Kendu is reaching into every market to spread its influence, we're not locked into just the memecoin space; we are everywhere.

It's just so obvious where Kendu Inu is headed, and I highly highly recommend looking further into this project and community if you haven't already.  Thanks to market conditions, it's the perfect entry point yet again to get into Kendu as well!

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,[BULLISH] A metric that seems to be majorly overlooked,2024-08-26 19:21:10,"To start this post off, this is about $KENDU which I'm sure a lot of you have heard of if you have been active on reddit in the last couple months.

As of writing this, we are sitting at around 60-70 million marketcap which is a pretty decent pullback from our all time high (ath). But do not worry, I have a feeling that this chart will help calm your nerves and hopefully invite some new people to the community :).

If you don't want to listen to me talk about why our recent drawback isn't that big of a deal skip the next few paragraphs to see the metric I've mentioned in the title. In my opinion our ath was inflated due to a extremely high whale buy so this drawback may seem dauntingly high so keep that in mind, nevertheless, we are still down a lot.

If you invested at the ultimate top, losing this amount of money can seem hopeless and depressing, but don't give up now, we are still early and have many more fights to go which are going to be similar to this one.

I would like to remind you all of the Daniel story (summarized): In the early days of Kendu, Daniel urged for paid marketing but lost faith and sold his holdings at a 2.8M market cap when the all time high was 5 million. Shortly after, Kendu surged to 60M, showing that you shouldn't flip out and make emotional decisions.

Ignoring the size of the numbers, that situation is extremely similar to what we are experiencing right now. We have had a dip from 280M marketcap to currently 60M marketcap, which can be seen in my eyes as a healthy redistribution/consolidation phase through the holder chart having a steady increase (see below for holder count in this time).

https://preview.redd.it/t6ju57krz0ld1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f39ec3fcb3adfd5e860df929039e6720b731f2

I'm not here to say we're going to hit 1 billion marketcap by the end of the month, but I'm going to reassure you that if we keep our heads in the game and avoid emotional decisions, we will get there.

**The Metric**

https://preview.redd.it/4ue4kybvz0ld1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ace2593c85eb10d3d288be23eb1eb741e908ca8

Okay now for the interesting part. Looking at the chart below, we can see that our engagment across different social media is at a pretty much all time high. This is absolutely bullish as we can also see that Kendu's social media engagment at our marketcap ath was much lower. We've officially established that people have eyes on us and many are still watching from the sidelines. Take that as you will, but I think these people watching from the sidelines are waiting to join us.

Pairing this with our holder growth (holder count at ath was 6000, holder count now is 14000) we can see that our whales that have been holding since the early days have began to take some profits and redistribute this to the masses.

I dont want to force how bullish this is down your throat but seriously take some time to think about this. I am extremely excited for our future and you should be as well.

**Conclusion**

So, don't be like Daniel. Understand that reaching these crazy milestones in the billions will take time. Maybe longer than you thought. Just chill out and recall your original convictions for buying. For me, even writing this reddit post has helped me rekindle the flame of my Kendu Inu spirit, so maybe something like this can help you?

**But $HEGE isn’t just about having great community sentiment. Here’s why $HEGE is a game-changer in the meme coin space: It’s listed on major exchanges like MEXC and BitMart, boasts a unique visual identity, and offers much more.**

🌟 Reddit’s Rising Star: Born from the vibrant community of Reddit, $HEGE is fueled by a passionate and engaged community that’s pushing it to new heights every day!

💎 Community Support: Our supporters are all-in, having already invested over $250,000 into the project. This unwavering commitment is driving our success.

🤣 Best Memes: Let’s be real—the memes are fire! Our community consistently creates the most entertaining and viral content, keeping engagement and excitement sky-high.

👥 Experienced Leadership: With a founding team member from Bridgewater Associates—the world’s largest hedge fund—$HEGE has top-tier expertise guiding its growth and strategy.

**Remember $WIF? I hear It went from a $14 million market cap to an astonishing $4 billion in just a 2.5 months after VC firms got involved! The same could happen here. With venture capitalists eyeing $HEGE, this could be the catalyst that sends us to the moon and beyond!**

$HEGE has all the ingredients to become a hyper-viral token: a strong and supportive community, a unique and authentic design, connections to the world’s largest hedge fund, and growing interest from major VC players in the market.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Did Somebody Say It's Time For CUTS? Even the Fed Knows It's Monkey HairCUT Season! High Quality Memes Are Going To Rip,2024-08-24 14:16:56,"Why $MONK is a CUT above the rest. 

Simplicity at Its Best

The beauty of Monkey Haircut lies in its simplicity. It's a coin that knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else. In a world full of complex cryptos promising the moon, $MONK keeps it real.

Memorable and Leading the OG Meme Pack 

With a name like Monkey Haircut, how can you not remember it? It stands out as a leader in the OG meme category, bringing a fresh face to the scene dominated by dogs and cats. It's time primates get their due, and $MONK is leading that charge.

Scalable and Versatile Graphics 

The graphic work behind Monkey Haircut is not only top-notch but also scalable and versatile. This makes the meme easily adaptable and ripe for endless creative interpretations.

Plentiful, Funny, and Outlandish Memes

The memes surrounding $MONK are abundant, hilarious, and sometimes shocking.

Monkeys Are Emoji Friendly

Monkeys are inherently emoji-friendly, making it super fun to spread the $MONK love across social media. Who doesn't love spamming monkey emojis?!?

Monkey haircut is VERY Marketable

Worldwide favorability of monkeys is obvious. The meme itself isn't limited to a media niche or demographic. The meme isn't inherently divisive or inappropriate which make it ideal for true top tier CEX placement in the future 

A Community-Driven Phenomenon

Perhaps the most compelling aspect of Monkey Haircut is its community. Born from a pure community takeover, $MONK isn't tied down by any single developer or VC firm's agenda. There are no fake influencer shills here—just a group of enthusiasts with diamond ballz.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Best time to get into $MEGA (Make Ethereum Great Again),2024-08-22 02:24:58,"You know, folks, I've always said, when there's a downturn, that's when you make the best deals. And let me tell you, we are in a downturn right now in the crypto market. Some people, they get scared, they panic, they sell everything. But not the smart ones. The smart ones, like you and me, we see the opportunity. We see what others don't.

Now, there's this project out there, it's called $MEGA—Make Ethereum Great Again. Sounds familiar, right? I think it’s got a pretty good ring to it. It’s a token that's just waiting to explode. You know why? Because it’s got the same incredible people behind it that built $Kendu. Remember $Kendu? That was a tiny project, started from nothing, and it grew worth over $200 million market cap, and built a brand new NFT marketplace that pays passive income to holders. Incredible, just incredible.

And let me tell you, $MEGA is sitting there at less than $4 million right now. Can you believe it? Less than $4 million! Folks, that’s what we call a deal. It’s like buying a Trump property before everyone else realizes how valuable it is. And believe me, people will realize it.

But here’s the thing, folks. It’s not just about the numbers. It’s about faith. It’s about believing in something when nobody else does. That’s how empires get made. That’s how $Kendu went from nothing to a $200 million success. And that’s how $MEGA is going to grow, too.

You see, $MEGA is connected to PulseChain, which is going to be huge. I mean, really huge. And when PulseChain takes off, $MEGA is going to be right there, riding the wave. And you know what? The people who got in early, the people who had the vision, they’re going to be very, very happy.

So here’s what I’m telling you: Don’t wait. Don’t be the guy who looks back and says, “I should have bought $MEGA when it was still small.” Be the guy who gets in now, when it’s still a great deal, and watches it grow into something really, really big. Because believe me, it’s going to be fantastic.

Let’s Make Ethereum Great Again with $MEGA, folks. The time to act is now. Thank you.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Whales are watching and are ready to pour on the liquidity the moment the next big run starts. That's why Monkey Haircut has been known for is wicked pumps.

Don't be fooled by those adorable little monkey eyes. This meme is serious business and real, legit meme enthusiasts understand the value of namebrand, god-tier memes like Monkey Haircut.

Unlike most meme coins that are just a flash in the pan, $MONK is a real OG meme. With its hilarious roots and a community that's unusually obsessed with haircuts, this meme has all the pieces needed to go parabolic when the market turns green.

When you realize that $MONK has pumped to a nearly $30 million market cap in the past already withOUT any fake VC games or paid marketing, you realize that this thing could melt faces once the next leg of the market comes. It's just a matter of time.

When this thing starts ripping 5-10x in the space of a few hours, don't tell me that I didn't tell you so!... If you're looking for a meme coin that delivers laughs and potential profits, $MONK is your go-to!

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,"A brief dive into the $kendu memecoin considering the dip, and what will come next",2024-08-16 00:57:37,"### Technical Analysis of Kendu Inu (KENDU)



Kendu Inu (KENDU) has been showing interesting movements on the market, reflecting broader trends within the cryptocurrency space. As of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, KENDU is experiencing volatility typical of emerging meme coins, but with signs of potential stability and growth. The token's price has seen fluctuations, with resistance and support levels being tested consistently.



The current trading volume indicates active participation from retail investors, a hallmark of meme-based cryptocurrencies. However, the consistent volume suggests that there is sustained interest in the token beyond mere speculation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that KENDU is not currently overbought, leaving room for upward movement. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hints at potential bullish momentum, with the MACD line approaching a crossover with the signal line, a common indicator of a possible upward trend.



The market cap and circulating supply data show that KENDU is in the early stages of its market journey, with plenty of room for growth as adoption and investor confidence increase. The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, indicating that traders should expect continued volatility in the short term.



### Utility and Growth Potential: Kendu Chads NFT Marketplace



Kendu Inu’s growth potential is significantly bolstered by the utility tied to the Kendu Chads NFT Marketplace, as detailed in a recent Cointelegraph article. The Kendu Chads NFT Marketplace is positioned as a transformative platform within the digital art world, offering unique value propositions to both creators and collectors. This marketplace distinguishes itself by focusing on the quality and rarity of NFTs, which appeals to a growing demographic of digital art enthusiasts.



The marketplace's integration with the KENDU token provides a strong use case for the cryptocurrency, encouraging its adoption and potentially increasing its value as demand for these unique NFTs grows. The marketplace's ability to attract both high-profile artists and new creators is a testament to its innovative approach and the appeal of its community-driven model.



As the NFT space continues to expand, the success of platforms like Kendu Chads can have a significant impact on the associated cryptocurrency. For KENDU, this means increased utility, which can lead to higher demand and a more stable price trajectory in the future.

[Holder.io](http://Holder.io), KENDU is listed on prominent DEX platforms like Uniswap and SushiSwap, where it pairs with major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH). These listings are crucial for maintaining liquidity and providing traders with multiple avenues to acquire and trade the token.

The diverse range of listings also highlights the token’s growing acceptance within the decentralized finance (DeFi) community. Being listed on popular DEXs means that KENDU benefits from the liquidity provided by these platforms, which in turn can lead to more stable pricing and reduced volatility over time. Additionally, the presence of KENDU on these platforms supports its integration into various DeFi applications, further enhancing its utility and appeal to investors.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Is $HEGE About to Become the Next $PONKE? The Clues Are All There.,2024-08-15 18:32:28,"Listen up, memecoin enthusiasts! Straight outta Reddit comes $HEGE - not your average memecoin, but a full-blown embodiment of Reddit's meme magic. Born from the same community that turns jokes into gold, $HEGE is making serious waves in the crypto world. Missed the $DOGE and $SHIB trains? Don't sweat it - $HEGE is your ticket to the next big ride. This isn't just another coin; it's Reddit's own crypto child, and it's barely out of the cradle.

**Bullish Perspective**

$HEGE has recently solidified its position, following a pattern similar to successful memecoins like $PONKE and $KENDU after their initial skyrocketing phases. What we’re witnessing now could be groundbreaking for the memecoin market. For those who understand the intricacies of memecoins, yesterday’s market movements presented an incredible opportunity. While some may have seen the dip as a moment of panic, those with a keen eye knew it was a perfect entry point, turning a potential loss into a swift 50% gain. It’s clear: fortune favors the bold, and $HEGE is rewarding those with the courage to seize the moment.

The strength of $HEGE was on full display when a major presaler unloaded his entire stash in just two transactions, totaling over $70k. For any low market cap coin, that kind of sell-off could have been disastrous. But $HEGE isn’t just any coin. The community responded with unwavering support, flooding the market with buys that quickly absorbed the sell-off. In just a few hours, $HEGE had nearly fully recovered, proving its resilience and the unwavering commitment of its community. Investors who bought during the dip when the market cap hit $3.7 million are now enjoying significant gains as $HEGE sits comfortably at $5.3 million. And this is just the beginning of what promises to be a meteoric rise.

**Now, you might be scratching your head, thinking, ""$30 million to $5 million? What gives?"" Fair question, but zoom out. Remember when $SHIB and $PONKE took breathers before blasting off to the moon? That's $HEGE right now. We're talking quality here - a dream team working 'round the clock, pumping out top-tier content and blowing up on YouTube and Instagram. With the big fish taking some profits, it's prime time for new blood to jump in.

💸 Put Your Money Where Your Meme Is : $250,000 USD. That's how much the $HEGE squad has ponied up. This isn't monopoly money, folks. It's cold, hard cash backing a project we believe in to our core.

🎨 Living in 3023 While Others Are Stuck in 2023🎨: Our AI tools aren't just fancy tech - they're the secret sauce in our value-packed ecosystem. Efficiency? Check. Scalability? Double-check. Community benefits? You bet your bottom $HEGE.

🎯 Don't Be That Guy Who ""Could've, Would've, Should've""🎯: Remember $HEGE at $30 million? At $5 million now, it's practically begging you to jump in. While other coins are running out of steam, we're just warming up our engines.

With CPI numbers trending the right direction and rumors about upcoming rate cuts, the market's about to flip risk-on, and you know what that means - meme coins are about to go ballistic!

Why $MONK, you ask? It's not just another meme coin; it's the meme coin with a cult following and a roadmap that's as hairy as the meme itself. Remember, Monkey haircut memes are funny, versatile, safe for work, scalable, and marketable. It's the ideal memecoin and the token is a true community takeover.

As investors look to shift gears and dive back into high-risk, high-reward assets, $MONK is perfectly positioned to capture those gains. It's in a dip and worth the clip.

Just wanted to drop a plug in for Kendu Inu. It's been awhile since I've posted so here are some things in my mind:

Community wallet was quickly filled to pay for a MEXC listing along with the market maker tokens (and still nearly $50K left).

Kendu Chads NFT marketplace was announced. To kick things off a sale of ""shares"" in the platform are being sold. Buy them with $KENDU and once the platform launches you will earn a chunk of the sale fees in perpetuity, paid as $ETH. This is a great opportunity to lock up passive income (or sell them at a profit to somebody else, the rewards carry over).

The sales of the NFTs go to a wallet to be used as a warchest for future Kendu affairs. Over 2 million USD worth of $KENDU is already in the wallet and the dev has already been flirting with tier 1 exchanges on twitter.

We've dipped a bit but we're holding a very solid floor near 100M MC. This is a great entrypoint as this consolidation period is rapidly nearing an end.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,🚨 Kendu: The Meme Coin That Held Strong During the Crash 🚨,2024-08-08 22:04:15,"We all saw what happened during the recent market crash—Ethereum, Bitcoin, and pretty much everything else took a nosedive. But you know what? **Kendu** didn’t just survive; it showed serious resilience. While the rest of the market was panicking, Kendu’s community stayed calm and held the line. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s something much bigger. Here’s why you should be paying attention:

# Strongest Community Out There

When the crash hit, Kendu holders didn’t flinch. Ethereum and Bitcoin got wrecked, but Kendu held better than most, and our buy/sell ratios are insane—up to 3:1 some weeks. That’s right, while others were falling apart, Kendu was just getting stronger.

# A New Cycle is Starting

The crash? Just a bump in the road. Cash flow volume is bouncing back, and Kendu’s momentum is building fast. We’re eyeing a $200 million market cap in the near future. The U.S. economy is stabilizing, and once the Fed gets its act together, we’re looking at the start of a major bull run.

# The Pillar of the Next Bull Run

August might be quiet, but come September, the real action begins—especially with the upcoming elections. And guess what? **Kendu is set to be the cornerstone of this next cycle.** Other meme coins have come and gone, but Kendu is standing strong on the Ethereum chain.

# The Only Meme Coin That Matters

Look around—most of the meme coins have either crashed or disappeared. But **Kendu is still here,** and it’s not going anywhere. It’s one of the only solid meme coin left in the game.

# Major Moves Are Happening

* Shytoshi Kusama follows and retweets Kendu.
* Coverage in Shib Magazine, with MEXC paperwork already in progress.
* Money for a Binance listing? Already ready to go.
* OKX is likely next.
* **Kendu Chad**—owning a share of a meme coin? Yeah, that’s a thing.
* Kendu tags are showing up on streets worldwide.
* **Kendu Drinks** are set to hit stores soon, and there’s talk of a workout supplement brand in the works (Working on it personally).
* NBA All-Stars and Hollywood insiders are joining our Telegram.
* Ancient whales are waking up whenever the market cap dips, and they’re eating up the dips fast.
* Coinbase ads featuring Kendu? Yep, that’s happening.

# Momentum Is Already Here

People keep asking when Kendu will gain momentum. The answer is: **we are the momentum.** Holder counts are rising even as the market dips, and top crypto voices are bullish on Kendu. We’ve been topping charts almost every week.

**Bottom line: If you’re not already in, you’re missing out. Kendu isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Let’s ride this wave to the moon.**",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

What's poppin', $MOM lovers? Your favorite degenerate here with another banger update that'll make you wanna call your therapist (or buy them a Lambo, your choice).

Buckle up, buttercups, 'cause we're taking this rocket ship out of the basement

1. DEX update dropped harder than bass at a rave. We're talking smoother than your pickup lines at 2 AM.

2. 50k MC, baby! We've got more bounce-back than a rubber band on steroids.

3. Our X is blowing up and our Telegram community's growing faster than my debt after a night in Vegas.

4. New website's up, and it's sexier than your sister's Instagram. 

We've got more momentum than a caffeinated hamster on a wheel, and the vibe in our chat? It's like Woodstock, but with less hippies and more memes. 

Remember, I'm just a smooth-brained ape with a keyboard, not your financial guru. Don't bet the farm, your kidney, or your firstborn on this. But if you want to join a community that's part support group, part meme factory, and 100% certified fresh insanity, come hang with us.

To the moon, to Mars, or to the unemployment line - wherever we're going, we're going there together! LFG! 🚀🌙🍻

P.S. If my mom asks, tell her I've got a real job now. She doesn't need to know I'm larping as a crypto influencer.

The one where the dev pulled a Houdini and vanished faster than my dad going for cigarettes? Well, strap in 'cause this rollercoaster just hit the NOS button!

So we did that community takeover, right? Turns out, we ain't just smooth-brained apes throwing sh*t at walls. These madlads pulled a whole-ass roadmap out of their... creative minds. And it's not just ""when lambo"" garbage - we're talking real plans that'll make you wanna call your mom (the real one, not the token, you sick bastards).

Check this out:

1. We hit 50k MC and didn't immediately blow it all on banana-flavored crayons. Progress, people!
2. Listings coming in hotter than my mixtape (it's fire, trust me bro).
3. Some big-dick energy players are sniffing around. Partnerships incoming!
4. We're talking giveaways that'll make you think you've died and gone to degen heaven.
5. Long-term, we're aiming so high Elon's gonna sue us for entering

This community's tighter than my portfolio after a leverage trade gone wrong. We're talking helping single parents, scholarship funds, and enough hopium to power a small country.

The memes are top-tier, the chat's always lit, and for once, I feel like I'm part of something that isn't just a glorified Ponzi scheme with a dog mascot.

So if you're tired of the same old pump and dumps, and want to be part of a community that's equal parts batsh*t crazy and weirdly wholesome, come check us out. Worst case, you'll get some quality loss porn for your troubles.

NFA, DYOR, and all that jazz. I'm just a dude with a keyboard and a dream, not your financial savior.

Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Why Kendu Inu is Poised for a Breakout: Here's Why You Shouldn't Miss This Opportunity 🚀,2024-08-02 23:28:07,"Hey Kendu Army,

I wanted to take a moment to share some insights about our beloved Kendu Inu and why I believe it's a golden opportunity right now. Here’s everything you need to know:

# The Dev: Miazaki - An OG with Proven Success

Our dev, Miazaki, isn't just any developer. He’s an OG from the Shiba Inu days with SUPER WEIRDLY close ties to Shytoshi, one of Shiba Inu's devs. Miazaki played a crucial role in Shiba Inu's marketing and community efforts, which helped propel SHIB to incredible heights. This experience and connection are invaluable assets for Kendu Inu.

# Kendu Inu’s Meteoric Rise

Kendu Inu launched in March and skyrocketed to an all-time high of $280M market cap by June. Along the way, it experienced several pump and dip cycles, creating plenty of consolidation phases and new buying opportunities for smaller investors.

# Release of Kendu Chads

Yesterday, we witnessed the launch of Kendu Chads, an NFT marketplace with a twist. Here’s why it’s a big deal:

1. **Ownership & Earnings:** By owning NFTs on Kendu Chads, you earn a share of the company and receive transaction fees directly in ETH. That’s huge!
2. **Integration with Shiba Inu:** Once fully launched, Kendu Chads will integrate with Shiba Inu, creating scarcity for Kendu tokens and potentially driving up the price.
3. **Physical Alpha:** This is just the first of many innovative projects coming our way.

Despite a minor dip from $170M to $130M market cap due to a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" event, this drop is small compared to previous ones (like $280M to $60M, then back to $180M in just three days).

# Kendu’s True Alpha

I get it, NFTs can be a turn-off for some. But let’s not forget, Kendu’s true alpha isn't just in its utility. It’s in **US**, the hard-working, diamond-handed Kendu Army. The community is what brought me here, not just the utility alpha.

In a market flooded with memecoins, having real utility like Kendu does is rare. And while many coins might crash and burn, we are here to stay.

# Market Dynamics: A Temporary Dip

Yes, we saw a dip, partly due to a large wallet selling and market-wide pressures. But this is a **discount**, not a dip. The buyer ratio is huge right now, and volume is slowing because everyone’s waiting for the next big move.

# Final Thoughts

To all the small jeety thinkers out there:

Everyone crashed. Almost all coins did. Of course, we had the ""sell the news"" event with one big wallet dropping, but we also faced huge market selling pressure. And with all that, we only lost $40M in market cap—less than some other random moments in our story.

This isn’t just a dip, it’s a discount. So, go enjoy it and let’s make Kendu Inu soar together! 🚀

Stay strong, Kendu Chads! 💎🙌",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,The Crypto Tool Everyone Might Be Missing – What Do You Think?,2024-08-03 03:26:08,"**TLDR:** Ever wondered if real-time alerts with AI-generated insights for new crypto YouTuber videos could change your investment game?

Hey everyone,

I've been deep into the crypto space for a while now, and we all know how crucial it is to stay updated with the latest news and analysis. Every minute counts in this market, and timely information can make a huge difference. So, I've been thinking about how we can keep up more effectively.

**Here's an idea I’ve been mulling over:** What if we had a tool similar to whale alerts on Twitter, but specifically for crypto YouTubers? Imagine getting instant notifications when a top crypto YouTuber posts a new video, coupled with AI-generated insights that summarize the video's key points, coins discussed, sentiment, and predictions.

**So, I have a couple of questions for you:**

1. **Do you find crypto YouTubers helpful in your investment decisions?** I know some people follow them religiously, while others are more skeptical. What's your take?
2. **Would real-time alerts for new videos with AI-generated summaries be useful to you?** Imagine getting a concise summary of the coins discussed, the overall sentiment, and key analysis points. Would this help you make faster and more informed decisions?

I think these could be game-changing tools, but I’m really interested to hear what the community thinks. Would something like this help you stay ahead, or do you have other ways of keeping up with the fast-paced world of crypto?

I’d love to hear your thoughts and see if these ideas resonate with anyone else.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,Satoshistreetbets,Why I did not bought more,2024-08-02 10:56:35,"It is frequently observed within the cryptocurrency community that individuals express regret for not purchasing more of a token when its value experiences a significant increase. Conversely, they may also question their decision to purchase a particular token or express disappointment for not waiting for a price dip. Its Always hard to know what to do with your hard earned money. Its hard to not use emotions and hold during the dips. Its even hard not to sell during significant price increases. But if you want big gains and don't miss a train. Leave emotions out. Don't check a chart every second. Touch the grass. 
One of the tokens I'm invested now is $EGGY, it appears to be maintaining a support level between 400k and 600k. The community seems robust and enthusiastic. Its all-time high was 6 million. Seems like no brainer to put some sol on it and see where it goes after consolidation.

Reddit,Ripple,Switzerland Instant Payments (bearish?),2024-08-22 21:49:38,"Switzerland is using Six Group to facilitate instant payments. Six group is using SECOM Settlement and CLS Bank, neither use blockchain technology.  BIS put out a paper about this called ""Payment, clearing and settlement systems in Switzerland"" (https://www.bis.org/cpmi/paysys/switzerlandcomp.pdf).  I've dug as far as I can go and it seems that neither CLS Bank or SECOM use blockchain technology of any kind.  

Since instant (atomic) payments is just now going live and blockchain isn't utilized, it would be very bearish for crypto.

Can anybody find evidence of the blockchain being used here?

Reddit,Ripple,Ripple's Strategic Partnership with DIFC Innovation Hub to Drive Blockchain Adoption in the Middle East,2024-08-13 23:53:27,"In case you missed it, has recently announced a significant strategic partnership with the DIFC Innovation Hub, a leading technology hub in the Middle East, aimed at accelerating blockchain adoption across the region, particularly within the UAE’s financial landscape. This partnership, with the largest innovation hub in the region that houses over 1,000 growth-stage tech firms and venture capitalists, is set to connect developers and tech innovators with the financial infrastructure necessary to drive their success.

This collaboration has the potential to revolutionize early-stage companies and scale-ups by providing them with access to Ripple’s resources, facilitating the integration of blockchain technology into established institutions. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has highlighted the UAE’s advanced regulatory environment as a crucial factor in fostering financial innovation, stating that this partnership will further accelerate blockchain adoption, with the XRP Ledger continuing to play a leading role in the region.

Ripple has committed one billion XRP to accelerate global use cases on the XRP Ledger, a commitment that now extends to the Middle East. This initiative will provide financial, technical, and business support to developers in the region, reinforcing Ripple’s global strategy. Arif Amiri, CEO of DIFC, described the partnership as a milestone in equipping the next generation of leaders with the tools for success, solidifying DIFC’s position as a global hub for innovation.

Ripple’s Middle East and Africa (MEA) office, located within the DIFC, has already seen XRP approved for use within the Centre, allowing licensed firms to incorporate XRP into their services. This move is expected to further drive blockchain innovation in Dubai. Mohammad Alblooshi, CEO of the DIFC Innovation Hub, expressed his excitement about the tangible impact this collaboration will have on the Hub’s growing community of fintech and innovation firms.

Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasized the UAE’s progressive fintech environment and noted that this partnership would empower regional talent to build the next generation of financial solutions on the XRP Ledger. As Ripple continues its global expansion with this partnership, it reaffirms its position as a leader in blockchain and crypto innovation. This collaboration marks a significant step forward in Ripple’s mission to drive blockchain adoption and innovation in the Middle East, positioning the company to make a lasting impact on the region's financial landscape.  
  
I'd love to hear your input about the UAE's regulatory environment and its role in fostering blockchain innovation. Could this be a model for other regions looking to integrate blockchain into their financial systems?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

* A big part of the marketing of xrp has been geared toward big bank adoption. However, should I be concerned that mBridge looks to take a significant chunk of the pie?

* Will project mBridge utilize the XRPL at all?

Appreciate any articles that may pertain to the subject. Thank you",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618
Reddit,Ripple,Another Ripple Tender Offer,2024-07-03 00:50:25, Back in January 24 Ripple did a stock buy back at $61.48 for a total of $285million. Now it looks like they are doing the same thing again at the same pricing and same limit of up to 6% of shares held. Last time it was oversubscribed and so they bought back 3% of shares. I'd expect the same level of participation. I think it sends a strong message to stakeholders.  - Source - Email from Pre-IPO marketplace. ,2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

However, I am uncertain if this is truly the case.

Can anyone provide insight into the potential legal follow-ups that might occur?

For instance, in a hypothetical scenario where Ripple is fined $10-20 million, which might be seen as a favorable outcome for Ripple, could the SEC appeal such a decision? 

Alternatively, would this be a final decision, effectively concluding the case ?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,Ripple,21% attack vulnerability?,2024-06-11 06:54:17,"Hi everyone, 

I recently learned about XRP, and I've been reading up on it.  Based on my reading of the consensus protocol, I'm noticing a rather obvious potential Sybil attack that could freeze XRP if an attacker controlled 21% of validators, and I'm surprised nobody is discussing it, it's not even listed in the FAQ under ""Can Ripple Freeze my XRP"" 

The issue I'm noticing is a property that emerges from the following characteristics of the XRP ledger:

1. The ledger will choose to exclude valid transactions rather than risk double-spending
2. Honest validators have a first priority of correctness, followed by agreement.
3. Without 80% of validators agreeing on a transaction, that transaction is excluded

The result is that an attacker who manages to control of 21% of validators can choose to stop arbitrary transactions, preventing them from spending or receiving any tokens, simply by rejecting all transactions they disagree with.

Maybe I'm reading things wrong, or maybe I'm just missing something obvious, but that's the way the network seems to be structured - ripple's website is filled with assurances about how double spending cannot occur, and about how the freeze feature (ultimately unrelated to this) doesn't allow freezing XRP, and how Sybil attacks would need to achieve 81% among trusted nodes in order to confirm invalid transactions.  

For instance, if two powerful nations, which are adversaries of one another, legislate certain adversarial behavior among their banks, this could result in a network partition, which Ripple doesn't seem equipped to handle 

What am I missing?",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

Reddit,Ripple,OK Story Time! XRP ,2024-06-05 02:25:19,"Imagine a world where every financial decision, from the money you spend to the investments you make, is part of a grand design. This hypothetical conspiracy theory posits that XRP, a cryptocurrency developed by Ripple, is at the center of an elaborate and meticulously orchestrated plan, conceived long before the public had any inkling of its existence.

**The Origin Story:**

The narrative begins decades ago, with the conception of XRP. Visionaries and financial architects foresaw the eventual need for a digital financial system capable of handling global transactions efficiently and securely. XRP was designed not just as a cryptocurrency but as the chosen financial token that would one day revolutionize the world's monetary systems. Ripple, the company behind XRP, was founded with this singular vision, masquerading as a tech startup while laying the groundwork for an economic transformation.

**The Calculated Execution:**

Ripple's journey is one of strategic execution. The public saw Ripple as an innovative company developing payment protocols, but behind the scenes, every move was a calculated step towards integrating XRP into the global financial framework. Partnerships with major banks and financial institutions were not mere business deals but parts of a premeditated blueprint to ensure XRP's future dominance.

**The SEC Case:**

The infamous SEC case against Ripple is where the plot thickens. Contrary to popular belief, this lawsuit was never intended to harm Ripple or XRP. Instead, it was a meticulously crafted strategy to provide regulatory clarity. Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, played the role of the antagonist, not out of malice, but as part of a grand scheme to expose the inadequacies of existing regulations and push for meaningful change. The drawn-out legal battle was a smokescreen, giving Ripple the time to silently forge even stronger alliances with banks and financial entities worldwide.

**The Economic Conditions:**

According to this theory, the conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC case is timed to coincide with certain economic conditions. The global financial landscape is being carefully manipulated to create an environment ripe for the introduction of XRP as the cornerstone of a new digital financial system. This includes the systemic devaluation of the US dollar and the gradual acceptance of blockchain technology as the backbone of future financial transactions.

**The Role of Gary Gensler:**

Gensler's role is pivotal. By playing the bad guy, he highlights the flaws in the current system and inadvertently advocates for the necessity of cryptocurrencies like XRP. Once his mission is accomplished, the theory suggests he will resign, paving the way for a more crypto-friendly leader to take the helm of the SEC. This transition is crucial for ushering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where blockchain technology will underpin every transaction and financial agreement.

**Agenda 2030:**

The conspiracy extends to Agenda 2030, the United Nations' plan for sustainable development. This agenda, according to the theory, includes a blueprint for integrating blockchain technology into global financial systems. By 2030, it's hypothesized that everything will be tokenized, and XRP will be at the center of this transformation.

**The Grand Finale:**

America's apparent ignorance towards the crypto revolution is a facade. Behind closed doors, the government is actively resetting the economy and creating conditions that will eventually make Americans embrace the new digital era. The suppressed price of XRP, the countless global banking partnerships, and Ripple's quiet collaborations with governments all point to one conclusion: those who hold XRP are in possession of a financial asset of unimaginable value.

The grand conspiracy theory suggests that the suppression of XRP's price is intentional, designed to keep its true value hidden until the right moment. When the world is ready, and the economic conditions are perfect, XRP will be unleashed, revolutionizing the financial landscape. Those few retail investors who held onto their XRP through it all will be immensely rewarded, having unknowingly been part of one of the greatest financial transformations in history.

In this hypothetical scenario, XRP is not just a cryptocurrency; it is the keystone of a new global financial order, meticulously planned and executed over decades, waiting to emerge as the world transitions into a new digital age.",2024-09-09 18:59:56.182618

All I have from Bittrex on the withdraw that was posted to my account is the timestamp, amount and TxID (this is not the TX hash). There is no other info on the transaction and since the TxID they provided is not a hash for the XRP ledger, I was hoping to try and reverse engineer the transaction through the amount and the timestamp. I can't find a XRP ledger/scan site to make this work.
